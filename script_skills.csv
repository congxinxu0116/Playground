"How are you feeling about that first simulation? That’s totally fine! It’s just practice. Let’s use this time to get you feeling prepared for your second attempt. One thing that made me so excited is that I saw you noticed every time a student misbehaved. That is so important because it shows me that you already have the lens to recognize misbehavior as soon as it begins.  To make your next simulation even stronger, I want you to focus on making your redirections more timely so that you can address the misbehavior right away. This prevents the misbehaviors from distracting other students and taking away from class time.  For example, I noticed in your last simulation that you were hesitant to correct   Ethan’s Dev's  behavior. Next time   Dav Ethan hums is whispering beatboxes texts sings talks about rocket club behaves a certain way   I want you to immediately redirect the behavior. For example, you could say:   Dev Ethan   voice off.  Let’s look at another example. When an avatar misbehaves how could you respond immediately to redirect the behavior? Exactly, that’s great. You could also say please stop talking. What would a response that’s not timely look like? Why is the first response better than ignoring the behavior? Exactly. Now I want you to actually practice redirecting a student. I will pretend to be an off-task student. I want you to redirect my behavior immediately. Ok? Why don’t you start by pretending to teach the lesson? That was great. You addressed my behavior right away. For the next session, you could try telling the student what to do instead of what not to do. Both strategies work because they make your expectations for student behavior clear. I’m so excited to see you redirect student behavior immediately in the next session!",Classroom_Management_Model_Script_1.txt,Classroom Management,1
"How are you feeling about that first simulation? Great! Hopefully we can get you feeling even more ready for the next one.  One thing that made me so excited is that I saw you responding to students’ misbehaviors as soon as those behaviors began. This is really important because it helps you stop the behavior quickly so that it doesn’t get worse, distract other students, or take time away from class.  To make your next simulation even stronger, I want you to focus on making your redirections more specific so that students know exactly what you want them to stop doing or start doing. This helps us make sure that students aren’t confused.    For example, I noticed in your last simulation that you told   Ethan Dev   to behave a certain way. The words behave a certain way can be confusing because it can mean different things for different people and you can’t see if a student is following those directions. Next time   Ethan Dev hums misbehaves whispers beatboxes is texting singing talks about Rocket Club behaves a certain way   I want you to tell them exactly what you want to see. For example, you could say:   Ethan Dev   , voice off, hands together.  Let’s look at another example. When   Ethan Dev hums whispers beatboxes is texting singing talks about Rocket Club   how could you respond to tell them exactly what to do? Exactly, that’s great. You could also use a non-verbal signal like this. What would a response that’s not specific look like? Why are the specific examples better than the non-specific example you just gave? Exactly. It should be direct, but not angry or mean. You can smile, use a positive tone, and say please to help convey respect and care. But we want it to be a statement and not a question so that you convey authority and it is clear what students need to do.  Now I want you to actually practice redirecting a student. I will pretend to be an off-task student. I want you to give a specific redirection that tells me what to stop doing or start doing. Ok? Why don’t you start by pretending to teach the lesson? That was great. You told me exactly what you wanted to see. For the next session, try to say it as an instruction instead of as a question so that there is no room for the student to be confused about whether they have to listen to you or not. I’m so excited to see you give specific redirections in the next session!",Classroom_Management_Model_Script_2.txt,Classroom Management,2
"How are you feeling about that first simulation? That’s totally fine! It’s just practice. Let’s use this time to get you feeling prepared for your second attempt.  One thing that made me so excited is that I saw you giving really specific redirections to students when they misbehaved. This is really important because it ensures that your directions are clear so that students understand what they need to do to meet them and were not confused. To make your next simulation even stronger, I want you to focus on making your redirections as succinct as possible so that they don’t take time away from the class discussion.    For example, I noticed in your last simulation that you told   Ethan Dev  to behave a certain way. While this statement is specific, it takes a lot of time away from class because it’s wordy. Next time   Ethan Dev hums whispers beatboxes texts sings talks about rocket club behaves a certain way   I want you to redirect them in as few words as possible. For example, you could use a nonverbal signal or simply say   “Ethan Dev, stop humming whispering beatboxing texting singing talking”  . Then you can go back to the class discussion Let’s look at another example. When   Ethan Dev  misbehaves how could you respond succinctly? Exactly, that’s great. Remember, you don’t need to explain rationale. That’s something you can talk about with the whole class as part of the norms discussion, but when a student misbehaves we don’t want it to interrupt the class. What would a response that’s not succinct look like? Why are the succinct examples better than the non-succinct example you just gave? Exactly. It should be short and direct, but not angry or mean. You can smile, use a positive tone, and say please to help convey respect and care.  Now I want you to actually practice redirecting a student. I will pretend to be an off-task student. I want you to give a succinct redirection that tells me what to stop doing or start doing. Ok? Why don’t you start by pretending to teach the lesson? That was great. You told me exactly what you wanted to see. For the next session, you can also try to use some non-verbal signals so that you’re not saying “stop” every single time. I’m so excited to see you give succinct redirections in the next session!",Classroom_Management_Model_Script_3.txt,Classroom Management,3
"How are you feeling about that first simulation? Great! Hopefully we can get you feeling even more ready for the next one.  One thing that made me so excited is that I saw you responding to students’ misbehaviors immediately with a very specific and succinct redirection. This is really important because it helps you stop the behavior quickly so that it doesn’t get worse, distract other students, or take time away from class. And because it was specific students knew exactly what to do.  To make your next simulation even stronger, I want you to focus on having a calm and positive demeanor when redirecting students. This is important because we want to balance being authoritative with being caring. We want students to follow our directions but we never want to make them feel scared or embarrassed in the process. We want them to feel that we as the teacher respect and care about them.  For example, I noticed in your last simulation that when you told   Ethan Dev to not to hum whisper beatbox text sing talk about rocket club behave a certain way   you used a slightly negative tone of voice and had a slightly negative expression on your face. This is totally understandable because it can be really stressful to lead a discussion while students are misbehaving. In those situations, it can be really helpful to use a nonverbal signal to redirect student behavior so that you don’t have to worry about controlling your tone of voice. It also gives you a minute to calm yourself down. Then you can smile afterwards and continue with the discussion. Let’s look at another example. When   Ethan Dev hums whispers beatboxes texts sings talks about rocket club   how could you respond with a calm demeanor? Exactly, that’s great. You could also this signal. What would a response that’s not calm look like? Why are the calm examples better than the non-calm example you just gave? Exactly. Now I want you to actually practice redirecting a student. I will pretend to be an off-task student. I want you to give a calm non-verbal redirection that tells me what to stop doing or start doing. Ok? Why don’t you start by pretending to teach the lesson? That was great. You conveyed everything you needed to with a non-verbal signal and then smiled and continued with the discussion. For the next session, think about how you can adapt the signal for each different misbehavior so that you don’t just use this one every time. I’m so excited to see you give calm redirections in the next session!",Classroom_Management_Model_Script_4.txt,Classroom Management,4
"How are you feeling about that first simulation? That’s totally fine! It’s just practice. Let’s use this time to get you feeling prepared for your second attempt.  Great! Hopefully we can get you feeling even more ready for the next one. One thing that made me so excited is that I saw you responding to each student with enthusiasm. This is so important because it affirms their participation and makes them feel like a valued member of the classroom community. To make your next simulation even stronger, I want you to focus on probing for textual evidence.  A strong answer or inference has three parts: a claim, textual evidence, and a warrant. Why isn’t a claim alone enough? Why do we want students to provide textual evidence? Exactly. It ensures that students are generating answers based in the text and helps us as the teacher understand their thinking. So in the last simulation,   Jasmine Dev   said Lisa was   feeling nervous a spy  . What was missing from that answer? Right, so how could you have given   Jasmine Dev   feedback to support them in providing evidence from the text? Yeah, you can also say “what evidence from the text makes you think that?” What’s another question you could ask to get them to identify text evidence?  How might this example be an improvement from your original response? Let’s practice. Ask me question 1, about who I think Lisa really is. I will answer as a student and then you respond to me. I think Lisa is Pizmo’s daughter.  That’s great! That question forces me to justify my answer. Next time, try to make sure you specifically ask students to give text evidence and not just a general reason for their answer. This helps make sure that students really understand the text and didn’t just get the correct by guessing. I can’t wait to see you probe for text evidence on the next simulation!",Feedback_Model_Script_1.txt,Feedback,1
"How are you feeling about that first simulation?  That’s totally fine! It’s just practice. Let’s use this time to get you feeling prepared for your second attempt. Great! Hopefully we can get you feeling even more ready for the next one.  One thing that made me so excited is that I saw you consistently asking students to give text evidence to support their answers. This is so important because it helps you understand each student’s thinking, which allows you to clarify or extend their thinking. And we want students to be answering the questions based on the text, not just a guess.  To make your next simulation even stronger, I want you to use this strategy of focusing on text evidence to help scaffold student comprehension when a student struggles with comprehending the text. Often when students struggle with comprehension they may give an answer that is not supported in the text or is explicitly disproven by the text. In this case, we want our feedback to support them in 1) understanding the text better and 2) revising their answer. Can you think of an example during the last simulation when a student gave a response that was not supported in the text or indicated that they weren’t fully comprehending it? Yeah,   Ethan Ava  said Lisa was   excited about her new job the new student intern  . Why isn’t this supported in the text? Right, in fact there’s evidence in the text that helps disprove that Lisa was   excited about her new job the new student intern  . What evidence did you notice? Yeah, so what feedback can you give to help the student better comprehend the text and revise their answer? Yeah, so you can start by asking them to give evidence to support their answer. That helps make sure that it doesn’t feel like you’re harshly correcting them. Then you can support the student in looking at that evidence again. If they can’t find any text evidence or it doesn’t support their answer then you can direct them to specific evidence in the text to help them revise their answer. And don’t forget to praise the student for revising their response. That makes it clear that it’s normal to misunderstand and not something bad or embarrassing. What’s another example of what you could say? How might that feedback be an improvement from your original response? Yeah, and it also helps ensure that other students don’t get confused by another students’ incorrect answer. Let’s practice. Ask me discussion question 1, about who Lisa really is, and then I will answer and you can respond. I think Lisa feels angry when Pizmo brings up her lie detector results. Well, it says her heart was pounding and that happens to me when I get angry. That was great! You did a great job of asking me to explain my answer and then pushed me to revise it. Don’t forget to praise the student for their revision efforts too. I can’t wait to watch you scaffold student understanding on the next simulation!

"How are you feeling about that first simulation? That’s totally fine! It’s just practice. Let’s use this time to get you feeling prepared for your second attempt. Great! Hopefully we can get you feeling even more ready for the next one.  One thing that made me so excited is how you responded to student misunderstandings. When   Ethan Ava  gave an   incorrect answer   you asked   follow-up question  . This is so important because it provided scaffolds to help them understand the text and did not confuse students by affirming an incorrect answer.  To make your next simulation even stronger, I want you to focus on providing high-quality descriptive feedback. This kind of feedback labels a desired academic behavior and explains the impact of that behavior, or why it is helpful. It’s important to do both parts because it helps students develop an understanding of key academic behaviors and encourages them to keep doing it in the future. This type of feedback will support them in understanding not just this text, but also future texts.  What is something that one of the students did in the last simulation that you would want them and other students to do in the future and why is this behavior important? Yeah, that’s great. Now, what feedback could you give that student to explain what they did well and why it was important? Yeah, you did a great job explaining what the student did well and why it was important. Why is that an improvement on your original response?  Yeah, I agree! Now, let’s practice. Pretend students have been discussion question 2. I will pretend to be Ava and you can respond to me. Ok? Well I was thinking about Dev’s response and I agree with some of what he said but not all of it. I think Lisa could be a spy, but I don’t think she’s a spy like in his spy movies working for the government. I think she is from another company and trying to steal One Thing’s ideas so her company can make the same stuff. I don’t get why the government would be interested in One Thing but if you think about like Google and Apple, since they make the same type of stuff kind of, it would make sense they would want to keep tabs on each other or steal each other’s secrets! Yeah, totally. Don’t forget to explain why the behavior is important though. Keep in mind that there are often lots of things you can praise. In this example you could also praise that Ava built off another student’s thinking, or how Ava was precise about which parts she agreed with, or how she made a connection to her knowledge of Google and Apple.

"How are you feeling about that first simulation? That’s totally fine! It’s just practice. Let’s use this time to get you feeling prepared for your second attempt. Great! Hopefully we can get you feeling even more ready for the next one.  One thing that made me so excited is that you did a great job of providing descriptive feedback to students that labelled important academic behaviors and explained why these behaviors are important. This is so important because it 1) helps this student understand the strength of their thinking process and 2) highlights the desired behaviors for other students so that they can replicate them. This supports students’ comprehension of this text and future texts.  To make your next simulation even stronger, I want you to focus on supporting students in giving a complete answer or inference. A strong inference has three parts: a claim is your argument or response to the question. Evidence is a quote from the text that supports your claim. The final part is a warrant, where you show your reasoning for why/how the evidence you provided supports your claim. Why isn’t a claim and text evidence enough? Why do we need the warrant? Yeah! Only certain pieces of evidence will be relevant to answering a particular question so we want students to be able to think about and articulate the connection to help them decide on what evidence matters. When a student gives a warrant it also helps other students follow along with their thinking so they aren’t left confused wondering how/why a particular piece of text evidence proves a certain answer. So in this last simulation when   Jasmine Dev  said Lisa was   feeling nervous a spy   you asked them to justify their answer with text evidence, which was great! But, what was missing? What kind of feedback could you have given them to support them in giving a warrant? Exactly. You to ask them what the connection between their answer and text evidence is. For example, “how does that evidence support your answer?” Can you think of another example of a question you could ask to probe for a warrant? How might the feedback you just generated be an improvement upon your original feedback? Exactly! Now, let’s practice. Ask me question 1, who I think Lisa really is. Then I will answer and you can respond to me.  I think Lisa is Pizmo’s daughter. That’s great! That gets the student to think about how their evidence connects to their answer. You can also try asking a more specific question to help them think through that connection as well. I can’t wait to watch you probe for a warrant in the next simulation!",Feedback_Model_Script_4.txt,Feedback,4
