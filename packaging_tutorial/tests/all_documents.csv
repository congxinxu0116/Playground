script,Classroom_Management_Model_Script_1.txt,behavior,behavior,1,"How are you feeling about that first simulation? That’s totally fine! It’s just practice. Let’s use this time to get you feeling prepared for your second attempt. One thing that made me so excited is that I saw you noticed every time a student misbehaved. That is so important because it shows me that you already have the lens to recognize misbehavior as soon as it begins.  To make your next simulation even stronger, I want you to focus on making your redirections more timely so that you can address the misbehavior right away. This prevents the misbehaviors from distracting other students and taking away from class time.  For example, I noticed in your last simulation that you were hesitant to correct   Ethan’s Dev's  behavior. Next time   Dav Ethan hums is whispering beatboxes texts sings talks about rocket club behaves a certain way   I want you to immediately redirect the behavior. For example, you could say:   Dev Ethan   voice off.  Let’s look at another example. When an avatar misbehaves how could you respond immediately to redirect the behavior? Exactly, that’s great. You could also say please stop talking. What would a response that’s not timely look like? Why is the first response better than ignoring the behavior? Exactly. Now I want you to actually practice redirecting a student. I will pretend to be an off-task student. I want you to redirect my behavior immediately. Ok? Why don’t you start by pretending to teach the lesson? That was great. You addressed my behavior right away. For the next session, you could try telling the student what to do instead of what not to do. Both strategies work because they make your expectations for student behavior clear. I’m so excited to see you redirect student behavior immediately in the next session!"
script,Classroom_Management_Model_Script_2.txt,behavior,behavior,2,"How are you feeling about that first simulation? Great! Hopefully we can get you feeling even more ready for the next one.  One thing that made me so excited is that I saw you responding to students’ misbehaviors as soon as those behaviors began. This is really important because it helps you stop the behavior quickly so that it doesn’t get worse, distract other students, or take time away from class.  To make your next simulation even stronger, I want you to focus on making your redirections more specific so that students know exactly what you want them to stop doing or start doing. This helps us make sure that students aren’t confused.    For example, I noticed in your last simulation that you told   Ethan Dev   to behave a certain way. The words behave a certain way can be confusing because it can mean different things for different people and you can’t see if a student is following those directions. Next time   Ethan Dev hums misbehaves whispers beatboxes is texting singing talks about Rocket Club behaves a certain way   I want you to tell them exactly what you want to see. For example, you could say:   Ethan Dev   , voice off, hands together.  Let’s look at another example. When   Ethan Dev hums whispers beatboxes is texting singing talks about Rocket Club   how could you respond to tell them exactly what to do? Exactly, that’s great. You could also use a non-verbal signal like this. What would a response that’s not specific look like? Why are the specific examples better than the non-specific example you just gave? Exactly. It should be direct, but not angry or mean. You can smile, use a positive tone, and say please to help convey respect and care. But we want it to be a statement and not a question so that you convey authority and it is clear what students need to do.  Now I want you to actually practice redirecting a student. I will pretend to be an off-task student. I want you to give a specific redirection that tells me what to stop doing or start doing. Ok? Why don’t you start by pretending to teach the lesson? That was great. You told me exactly what you wanted to see. For the next session, try to say it as an instruction instead of as a question so that there is no room for the student to be confused about whether they have to listen to you or not. I’m so excited to see you give specific redirections in the next session!"
script,Classroom_Management_Model_Script_3.txt,behavior,behavior,3,"How are you feeling about that first simulation? That’s totally fine! It’s just practice. Let’s use this time to get you feeling prepared for your second attempt.  One thing that made me so excited is that I saw you giving really specific redirections to students when they misbehaved. This is really important because it ensures that your directions are clear so that students understand what they need to do to meet them and were not confused. To make your next simulation even stronger, I want you to focus on making your redirections as succinct as possible so that they don’t take time away from the class discussion.    For example, I noticed in your last simulation that you told   Ethan Dev  to behave a certain way. While this statement is specific, it takes a lot of time away from class because it’s wordy. Next time   Ethan Dev hums whispers beatboxes texts sings talks about rocket club behaves a certain way   I want you to redirect them in as few words as possible. For example, you could use a nonverbal signal or simply say   “Ethan Dev, stop humming whispering beatboxing texting singing talking”  . Then you can go back to the class discussion Let’s look at another example. When   Ethan Dev  misbehaves how could you respond succinctly? Exactly, that’s great. Remember, you don’t need to explain rationale. That’s something you can talk about with the whole class as part of the norms discussion, but when a student misbehaves we don’t want it to interrupt the class. What would a response that’s not succinct look like? Why are the succinct examples better than the non-succinct example you just gave? Exactly. It should be short and direct, but not angry or mean. You can smile, use a positive tone, and say please to help convey respect and care.  Now I want you to actually practice redirecting a student. I will pretend to be an off-task student. I want you to give a succinct redirection that tells me what to stop doing or start doing. Ok? Why don’t you start by pretending to teach the lesson? That was great. You told me exactly what you wanted to see. For the next session, you can also try to use some non-verbal signals so that you’re not saying “stop” every single time. I’m so excited to see you give succinct redirections in the next session!"
script,Classroom_Management_Model_Script_4.txt,behavior,behavior,4,"How are you feeling about that first simulation? Great! Hopefully we can get you feeling even more ready for the next one.  One thing that made me so excited is that I saw you responding to students’ misbehaviors immediately with a very specific and succinct redirection. This is really important because it helps you stop the behavior quickly so that it doesn’t get worse, distract other students, or take time away from class. And because it was specific students knew exactly what to do.  To make your next simulation even stronger, I want you to focus on having a calm and positive demeanor when redirecting students. This is important because we want to balance being authoritative with being caring. We want students to follow our directions but we never want to make them feel scared or embarrassed in the process. We want them to feel that we as the teacher respect and care about them.  For example, I noticed in your last simulation that when you told   Ethan Dev to not to hum whisper beatbox text sing talk about rocket club behave a certain way   you used a slightly negative tone of voice and had a slightly negative expression on your face. This is totally understandable because it can be really stressful to lead a discussion while students are misbehaving. In those situations, it can be really helpful to use a nonverbal signal to redirect student behavior so that you don’t have to worry about controlling your tone of voice. It also gives you a minute to calm yourself down. Then you can smile afterwards and continue with the discussion. Let’s look at another example. When   Ethan Dev hums whispers beatboxes texts sings talks about rocket club   how could you respond with a calm demeanor? Exactly, that’s great. You could also this signal. What would a response that’s not calm look like? Why are the calm examples better than the non-calm example you just gave? Exactly. Now I want you to actually practice redirecting a student. I will pretend to be an off-task student. I want you to give a calm non-verbal redirection that tells me what to stop doing or start doing. Ok? Why don’t you start by pretending to teach the lesson? That was great. You conveyed everything you needed to with a non-verbal signal and then smiled and continued with the discussion. For the next session, think about how you can adapt the signal for each different misbehavior so that you don’t just use this one every time. I’m so excited to see you give calm redirections in the next session!"
transcript,1-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"So how do you feel about that first simulation? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Absolutely. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So one thing that I noticed that I liked was during those interruptions you maintained your cool and so sometimes when those interruptions do come up can kinda throw you off kilter- And so you kept up a nice affect, you maintained a-a smile or a friendly face, didn't necessarily display some visible frustration which when those kinds of things come up can really influence the environment of the classroom. So that was one thing that I thought went really well is that you just sort of stayed calm- But I think the area that we can focus on is identifying specifically the behaviors that you think are distracting where they are, that might need some redirection and then just naming those to the individual student and then we can see if that actually gets the anger redirected. Okay. So for example, like it one of the- one of the initial pieces when Ethan at the beginning started making some noises- during most of these interruptions that occurred over the simulation, you continued all at the lesson as you mentioned- But I think the shift could be, how can we address those behaviors, so that you can actually get some of those contributions. So it's important to specifically name the behaviors that you're observing with the particular student and then giving them a specific action or a feedback on how they can actually redirect their own behavior. You're with me so far? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. So that's-that's little long. How could you shorten that up even more? So I notice that you know, again, in the last simulation you just sort of kept on going- with establishing the rules- and so how could you make that redirection that you just mentioned more succinct? ""Ethan voice off, please."" Again, something really simple and if you wanna even do a non-verbal, you could look directly at Ethan   environment but you could turn and look at Ethan and just you know for that- that provides a non-verbal cue, but again that effect piece is still important. But I think you know an overarching piece for us to work on is specifically naming the behaviors, so we've got that example for Ethan. So, ""Ethan, voice off, please."" Or, ""Ethan, stop humming, please."" All right. So that names it and that gives them an action, so I'd like you to stop humming. All right. What about- what about Dev? When Dev brought up the superhero piece. So there was an attempted engagement- But how could you redirect the behavior to maintain focus on the rule piece? Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, and so as you could name at the very beginning is, ""Dev that's an off-- that you know that's a little bit off topic and I would like you to hold that response until later on and so we-when we get to it."" So you've identified the behavior. You know Dev has a little off topic- and then you've given a specific action or what to do- which is, ""Dev, you know I'd like you to hold that and please don't talk about that"" or ""well, you know we'll come back to that later on."" It gives us so again, the identification specifically of what the behavior is and then providing them with that action step to follow up- and then all the while you'd maintain that-that stable effect, you know you're trying to maintain your calm. But you know one of those pieces, you still works on a specific thing. All right. So- Yeah, but again with that precise language to those, ""So Dev please hold that thought. We're gonna come back then- I'll come back to that later and I'll give you a chance to share but for now, you know please- yeah please let's focus on this one."" 'Cause that again, the identification piece and the action piece for the redirection. So in terms of the non-response, what will that none who response look like? From you, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. We're good. Right. So the suggestion is you're-- you know the piece that we talked about, you're naming the behavior and you're trying to catch it off. All right. So if I'm dead and if I'm off a task you know blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, how could you respond? Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah- Dev, eyes on me. So real specific feedback, you've redirected them and so now he's back for attention and that gives you your attention back for the rest of the class, so you can proceed. 'Cause as you mentioned you try to talk over. You know that's a little bit tough because the behaviors are still there so how can we nip those behaviors in the bud with real specific and real succinct feedback. Okay. I'm excited to see you try. Okay. "
transcript,10-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"Okay, so I think that wins. Don't like the simulation? Why is that? Okay, anxious. How about this particular experience? How-how'd you feel about that? Yeah, it does. But one thing I did see you do well is that despite all of those potential issues, you maintain your cool. So, like, an immediate response typically is to get frustrated, and then you might raise your voice and then you might start to get a little unreasonable or irrational, yeah, it wasn't like, ""Turn to the corner."" Something like that as opposed to a different type of addressing behavior point that would- not be as- as like that. So that's one thing you did really well. And so why is it important for you to maintain your calm? Yeah, so in a couple examples I saw at the very beginning, so when Ethan was making some video game noises or when Ethan started to whistle- you just continued to go on to try to set the expectations. But then when you asked a question to the other members of the class about suggestions, did they respond? They didn't. No, so what could have been a potential option there? Sure, but I'm talking about the video game noise specifically, so what could have been a response to that? Yeah. All right, so what would that look like? Yeah, well, so- so I want to challenge you to push back on that. So to be more specific and to be more succinct. So if Ethan's making some video game noises, how would you respond in a way that's specific and succinct that redirects his behavior back to what you'd like him to do? Okay, so let's go to that ""we"", is that specific? No, because it could, you know, Jasmine might be like, ""I wasn't doing anything, you know, what do you mean 'we'."" You realize that state. You think that's more specific that 'we'? Yes, absolutely, all right. Yeah, I mean, the goal, like, usually when you-when you do a name piece as well, you're establishing that my attention is now to you, is typically why would you want to do a red- or why- why are they misbehaving. Yeah, or they're used to trying to gain attention and so, you know, by doing a quick name, for example, you might give them that sliver of attention, but then you're immediately going to name the behavior and you're going to redirect the behavior- by giving them an action step. Okay, so what would a nonresponse look like if Ethan continued to say drum? What would a nonresponse from your end look like? You would ignore it? And what potentially could happen if you ignored it? Yeah, and so why is it important to address the behavior as soon as you see it? You get it to stop and what's even more important, not only does he stop, what does that permit you to do? I could do that, but what's it- I mean what's just a broader benefit to you to addressing the behavior immediately when it happens? What are you trying to do? Uh, fair, but you've done that. But then by doing that, what does that enable you to do? So if- if you identify the behavior with Ethan- ""Ethan, stop drumming, eyes on me"", what does that enable you to do after you say that? You can go back to teaching. Yeah, yeah, something just real, so by attending to those behaviors very specifically and quickly, that permits the classroom to continue that flow, and lets you continue teaching. Okay? So, let's do- let's do a practice. All right, so I'll be an off task- I'll be an off task student, and so I want you to practice- being specific and naming the behavior and giving an action step. Okay? So if I'm Jasmine. Great, so now what if you don't know it's my phone? So what if I'm just doing this? Great, great. So you skip the identification because you're not necessarily sure what it is and you just- But you gave her a specific action step on what you'd like her to do, right. So let's say, we'll just do one more before you have to jump back in. So, how else could you be specific with if I am, you know, doing some drumming? Okay, even more specific, or even more succinct, excuse me. And then action step. Eyes on me. Great. Let me say this, you try it. Okay, let's see them again."
transcript,102-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"Okay. Yeah, you want-- Yeah. So, generally, how do you feel? Okay. Well- I was just gonna say we'll talk and we'll try to give you, like some good tools- that will hopefully, like, reduce your stress a little bit- 'cause that's what we-we want to do, okay? Um, so I thought it was really good that you provided a lot of, um, specific feedback to students, you know, stop drumming, voices soft, like that. So,, you did very like targeted- uh, redirections, which was really good. Um, so for this next time to make your stimulation even stronger, I want you to think about providing succinct redirections. Uh, so for example, in your last simulation, I'm thinking specifically about, um, like devs, superhero- . Um, I think, uh, like, you need to be like- try to limit, you know- time that you're to talk about it. And so, or even let's think back to like the first one like with Ethan's, uh, humming, I think it was. Um, I want you to try to redirect them with the fewest words possible. And, so we'll, uh, let's do the last one when Ethan was doing this impersonation. Uh, so you can just do, ""Ethan, stop the impersonations."" Um, something like that. Um, why do you think that, like it would be better to say, ""Ethan, stop the impersonations,"" or-- so you said in the- during the simulation, ""Do you think that's applicable in the classroom?"" um, you know, more classroom-oriented. Why do- you think maybe better to do the, ""Stop the impersonations""? Yeah. So,, I'm gonna-- let me see if I'm-I'm thinking this. So, it's giving them like the flexibility that they can interpret what-- you're saying in other ways. Yeah. Yeah. . Yeah. They can see me, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That expectation. Okay. Okay. Stop drumming. That just sounds so-- it's like so hard for me. Like I wanna have please, but I feel like-- that's also like-- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. I think I'm just gonna jump back in. Um, no. If I can't hear them, like, um, when he was talking about the superhero thing, I feel so bad, 'cause I was like, ""What were you saying?"" and then I was like, ""Oh, the superheroes,"" like, ""Oh, no."" Okay, perfect. Okay. Okay. I'm ready."
transcript,103-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"All right. Why don't you have a sit and we'll-- we'll chat about the worst thing ever. Yeah. So, I think like there are-- I definitely understand what you're saying like that there are like issues with it but like there are still like some really good like skills that we can practice and that like this is really a good way for us to see them in action and like, ""Wow, I can see like, you know, these five minutes might be different. Like you're still gonna have students who act like this and like who are gonna be, you know, doing something that you don't want them to be doing."" So, if-I was like trying to figure out like how we can best support you like so, with those skills. Yeah, the proximity thing is like so infuriating. You can't like go- and stand and like-- that one I totally understand. But even like when you go, you stand next to them and they still continue, like what do you say to them to get them stop. Cause sometimes it is just like them they get it but like sometimes it's not. So we're like, you know, how do we get that, like this? We're all on board with that. so- Right. So, you have to get the behavior to stop. Like that's like-- So, what we have to think about like, perform to-- you know, like hunt every directions. We have to get this misbehavior to stop. So, a lot of times what it is with students is like is-is specifically meaningless like behavior that you wanna have stop. So, like not letting Ethan keep going with drumming or humming or cursing at someone and like getting that behavior to stop and then you can teach him. So, if you're-- for example, if Ethan is drumming on the desk or something. So, I'm gonna be like, ""Ethan, we're not drumming right now, but do you have something that you wanna add?"" Yeah. Yes, but generally like do they-- and-and he didn't engage with me at all. Yes. I mean, would you in a repressed environment just tell the students like just stop? Would that be your first instinct?  Yeah. And then what do I do if he says no? That's okay. The last time I was in a simulation. Yeah. Yeah. But I can't do that right now. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Like my current-- my-- The way I've been trained was always to ignore the negative behavior and redirect it positively. So, like I wouldn't say, ""Please stop that."" I would- Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Absolutely. Sweet. Okay. Let's do it. "
transcript,104-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"How do you think that went? How are you feeling? Okay, all right. So how are you feeling? What's a likely thing if you don't address Ethan's behavior or Dev or Jasmine's behavior? What is it preventing you ultimately from doing? From teaching, yeah. One of the thing I saw you did really well is that you did not lose your cool. And why is it essential fir you to not lose your cool? Why is it precipitately dangerous for you to lose your cool in a middle school classroom? Yeah and also on your end. Yeah yeah. Well it also just e-elevates the whole situation and you're likely to get   the kids up as well, you know. In addition to you, what-what-- You didn't lose your cool, which was awesome, you know, in the face of adversity. So that's great. Um, one thing I wanna focus on in our brief conversation is on providing specific and succinct redirections. So, you know for example in the-in the second redirection, when I just made a suggestion of you know, ""Ethan, voices off, eyes on me."" You know, real simple, real succinct, you said that and then Ethan you know, complied. But there were a couple of instances that I noticed where-- I appreciate that you were trying to you know drag in some of the off chest behavior to make it applicable, but what's a consequence of trying to do that more often than not? Fair, and then what-what-what what's another like likely consequence, if you always entertain those kinds of contributions  Yeah and so it's like an- again, ultimately prevents you from  setting expectations as a teacher. Yeah, all right. So, let's take for example like Ethan's drumming. So what's a specific succinct redirection to nip that in the bud as soon as it starts? Is that likely to work? No, all right. So often times we see this misbehave, what's one of the more common reasons they do misbehave? Okay, or they're just simply- they want what? They just want attention, yeah. So one thing I wanna encourage you to do in this next simulation session-session is to name the student that you're about to redirect, as- so-so 'cause what was a consequence of saying you know, ""We should have our listening ears on."" You know, what's a consequence of that? Yeah, right. And what about that do to the students that are actively listening? Yeah 'cause they'll like, ""I was listening, you know, what do you mean by listening, ears on? I was there."" So the first thing is to name the student and then I want you to name the behavior, and then name the action steps. So those are three steps of this formula for the next session. So, for example, like let's say that Savannah contributes something that's off task or off-topic. What's a specific redirection if I say, ""I love the Salisbury steak that I had at lunch today. It was great."" How can you be more succinct? Fewer words, 'cause you're still teaching. So how can you be more succinct? Is that specific? Let's. Yes, yeah so that is an off task contribution, ""May I ask you to, you know, voices off for now while we continue to set some rules."" So you've identified the behavior it's an off cast contribution or an off cast piece right now. Voices off please while we continue to set expectations. So you've identified her, you've identified the behavior and then you've identified like, you've given her another specific action step. Do we have some more? So one more practice. So let's say that you don't know that I have my phone with me but I'm looking down. What's the- and my name is Mike. What's a specific redirection? Yes, or really simple, uh you know, ""Mike, heads up, eyes on me."" You know or, ""Hands on lap,"" or something like that. So again you just- you've got to name the behavior and then you- 'cause they don't really know and you've got to give them an action step. 'Cause if not, it's like you know, ""We should be listening."" It's very very vague. Okay? So I'm excited to see you try. All right? Name, specific behavior, and then action step. Sounds good? I might jump in, I might not. All right? We'll see how you do. "
transcript,105-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"Alrighty. So how do you think that went? You can   that. So I need to keep it off for the second session. You just keep it clutched. How do you think that went? Yeah? What do you mean? How do you feel? Okay. Okay. What does it mean, though, went okay? Sure, yeah. Okay. Okay. One thing I saw that I-- that I really liked was you were pretty specific in offering redirections to give the students who were a little bit off task with an action step to follow, which I thought was great. Um, and you did most of it by maintaining your cool, um, which is another thing. So, why is it important to specifically name the behaviors you're observing that you necessarily don't want them to do? Yeah, like why is it important to specifically name them? Both. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Sure. Yeah. And what's the benefit of specifically naming an action step for them? Particularly in this middle school classroom. So like, you know, ""Dev, I need you to stop talking."" Like, what's the benefit of that- type of redirection? Yeah. Like you keep-- yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's-it's really at a-- at a base level- you've given them something to do. Like an action step, as opposed to something that's vague, you know, like, ""We're listening right now,"" and it's like, ""Hmm,"" you know, not necessarily- and so by naming. So when students really act out in class, what do they really want in the beginning? Yeah and so like using that name, use that-- use that personal connection, as you mentioned, but it also sort of gives them the like, ""Oh, I was noticed."" You know, ""I saw that."" And so, that's, you know, recognizes that-that potential need at that moment. So that's-that was a good thing. And then by giving them a specific action step, you're telling them a recommendation on what you'd like to see them do, as opposed to being a little bit more generic. Yeah. So, let's see, one thing, why don't we-- why don't we try to do like a-- do a rehearsal? So, what would be a specific and, um, sort of a succinct way to correct my behavior right now if my name is Mike. Okay. How could you be more succinct? Let's say you don't know I'm on my phone. So you were good there, 'cause you wouldn't have known with the desk potentially. How would you be more succinct though? More succinct. Fewer words. Well, you could just say, ""Eyes on me,"" potentially. Yeah. So something like a real simple, you know, redirection. And then what if I respond back with, ""Oh, I'm sorry, I'm-I'm just using my phone."" Okay. Or just real quick, ""Phones away."" ""Cause you're still trying to do what? Yeah, you're still trying to maintain the pace of the lesson. And so, you know, try to use fewer words, help sort of preserve your flow as an instructor, as opposed to stopping potential flow and then saying, you know, ""Mike, what are you doing over there?"" You know, 'cause that sort of interrupts your piece as oppose to, ""Mike, phones away, eyes on me."" You know, real quick and you just keep on moving. But I know we're in a   environment, but- you know, try to find ways to just be pretty specific. So, what if I contribute to the conversation with something that's not relevant? How could you respond to me if I'm like- So if I say, you know, ""I really love the walls in this classroom. They're great, and you know, I wanna go to the fun zone later on,"" you know, what's a specific- way you could redirect my behavior? Okay. How could you shorten that even more? So, ""Mike, voice--"" ""Mike voices off."" And, uh, or you could even a-- just a non-verbal cue of, you know, ""Mike, voices off,"" and you could do that in front of your mouth as well. Just you're trying to give them some kind of an action step, you know. How are you feeling? Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So what would a non-response from you look like when, let's say, I'm whispering, la la la. What's a non-response from your angle? What would you let me? Yeah, and you would just let it keep going. And what's the problem there? And then what potentially could happen? Right, and then they potentially start to do it as well. So yeah, it's important to sort of nip those early on, and then as we talked about, be specific. You know, name the student, and then name the action that you'd like them to do. And try to focus on, you know, those succinct redirects. You know, ""Voices off, pencils down, hands on the desk."" You know, just real simple. All right? You all right? Okay. I'm excited to see you try. All right. Just wanna put that back in your view. Uh, and then I might pop in on occasion with this. Um, but if I don't, don't be alarmed. Sounds good? Okay. Whenever you're ready, just tell Rose. "
transcript,107-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"How are you feeling? Yeah. It's okay- this is just practice and so we'll use this time now to make you feel little better about when you go back in but, yeah, I totally get you- um, so one thing that I saw that you were doing really well is your really timely in your responses with   of behaviors would begin, right? So you would-- and you return your attention to-- like let's say when Ethan was doing this drumming impersonation- you know, you would turn your attention to him and you said, ""Ethan it sounds like you got a lot of great things to do about."" right? Um, so you're kinda trying the-- you're showing him that you acknowledge his behavior is not appropriate right now- and- and so in that kind of clues the- the student centenering like, ""Okay, like I need to start thinking about my behavior."" right? So your kinda giving them that opportunity to reflect a little bit- um, so you were definitely good in noticing the behavior occurring, and trying to kind of group them together- um, you didn't just ignore it in like, um- so that was awesome. Um, one thing that I want you to work on in when you go back in, is being a little more specific- with your, um, with your redirections. And so-- let's see, you probably heard me clicking away taken down notes- um, so, let's see, let's see. Um, okay. So way back in the beginning when Ethan was whistling- you said, ""Ethan I would really like, um, to be able to hear how Jasmine feels about- the first day of school."", and you said again, ""Ethan, I would really like you to keep, um, calm quite voice so I can hear Jasmine."" And, you know, he was whistling so he then- you know, continue- Mm-hmm. but, um, won't you be specific with the directions, so its- its like you're telling Ethan exactly what it is that you want to see him do or see him stop doing. Um, so in that situation when Ethan was whistling, what could you have said that was specific- that would be specific. Right. You can- you can do- Yeah. You can do that and still be specific, right? Do you want him to be quiet or do you want him to stop whistling? You see that the same? So what do you say to him? Perfect. Yeah. Just, ""Ethan, please stop whistling"". Right? 'Cause that's the exact act, right? So when you said, ""Um, I need you to be calm and quite""- those terms are, um, subjective, right? Well, what's calm to me might not be calm to you- so you want to make sure you want to remove the list that, um, subjectivity there- and, um, just be very specific. So, I'll give you-- let's see, another example, um, okay so Ethan started talking in a silly Darth Vader voice- right? And you said ""Ethan, it sounds like you've a lot of things to share, you know do you have a pen and pencil with you?""- and- and you said, ""Okay, you know, you're really into Star Wars, maybe we can do some voice practicing later on, but its important for us to get to know each other today."" so-- and he kind of kept on going, right? So again, you identify that you need him to do something, but you didn't specifically name it, so what could you specifically do next time, he's talking in a Darth Vader voice? Yeah- Ethan, please stop talking like Darth Vader. Thank you. Um, yeah you can just name the behavior, right? And that's you or you can still be warm and do that. Um, so, do you see what thats- why is it better to be specific than to kind of have-- you know, just be quite, or-- Perfect, yup. Yeah. You can- you can repeat it, so here you can try rope it, I'll start whistling, and you be specific.  Great. I knew exactly what you want me to do. Right, so just- again- Perfect. Thank you. Just make sure you're using your teacher voice when you're in there. Awesome, okay. How you feel? Awesome. I know, I know- but you'll be great in there. So I'm excited to see you a little more- specific in your redirection."
transcript,108-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"So how you-how you feel, what do you think? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we'll talk about some ways and maybe some tools that will help you like redirect behaviors, and you can get back to, like, establishing these norms and not have to spend so much time. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And just get back to what you want to do. Um, so one thing that like, I think you did a really nice job and handle things very well. I really appreciate that. Like, every time there was, um, some sort of a misbehavior, whether it was off task chatter or rather humming, whatever it was, um, you always acknowledge that and that like can sound like kind of silly- but it's really important to acknowledge the behavior- um, 'cause now we can start working, like you're noticing it. You are seeing it there. I'm trying to do something so now we can just like fine tune these, these skills- like hope, I haven't stopped- yet sooner. And so in the, um, next simulation one thing that I want you to think about is really providing specific redirections. And so let's think about, um, some of the things, um, okay. When Ethan, um, switches into Darth Vader- or whatever. And so in the simulation, you are talking to Eva a little bit about um, why asking questions is good. So he's still talking, um, and he says, ""Hey Ethan remember one of my expectations to sit silently. Let's listen to what Eva has to say and will come back to you"". And he kind of like goes back and forth And things like that and but behavior never really ends. So one of the things is just trying to be really specific with students as to what you want. Um, so for example, in this instance, Ethan's using Darth Vader voice. You could simply say, ""Ethan, I need you to use your regular voice."" Yeah. So if you're saying like, I need you to be thinking about these things, and you have to like-- the middle school kids can get like super snarky. And so like, that's where being as specific as possible is. Good. Um, so if you say I need you to be picking up this Yeah, so it's like, what is like really  thinking about what is the action that you want to have. Yeah. And so, I mean part of it and it's really hard to like teach this, is you just using like a calm voice You're not like you're not trying to attack You're not trying to do anything. And like if you are like, ""Ethan, I need you to stop using that voice right now"" It's much different than being like, ""Ethan, I really need--"" You know, so that that is where a lot of the new ones is gonna come in, And that being as specific as possible with that. So why do you think that that like using specific reactions would be better than um, like trying to engage this back and forth? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And there's no, there's no light gray area in their mind. Like if you're naming if you're being very specific status if this is what I need to have happened there's no room for interpretation. And you know, so if dad when he was getting off about plastic man, it's like you were trying to connect it to the world and like, I was kind of getting into like, ""Dev, I need you to stop talking about, plastic."" You need to-- It's like you can end those things And it also, it just buys more time for you to get what you want to have done, done instead of constantly recollecting. So, we'll practice I will be an off-task student, um, my name is Colleen if you forget it. and you can um, redirect it So That's really good. So I really like that you, you're very specific. You need me to stop humming and then you try to, like you ended behavior and could go up to your expectations. So you wanna, you want to think about it in that order instead of going like-- Yeah. Okay? So being very specific and then, and then-- Do have any questions for me? Okay. So, so you're gonna go back in five minutes. Start from the beginning and like nothing ever happens."
transcript,109-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"How do you feel about that? The first one-- The first-- Yeah. Right, right. But you still gotta stop that behavior. Because otherwise, you'll never be able to set the expectations. So you right in this like, there is a balance between it and I think a lot of it can come through like you're- you're voice and like using a calm voice like if you're not-not like-- Hmm, you know what I mean? So, um, we'll-- We will talk about that and hopefully, we can give you some good practical skills that you can use that will like help redirect them in like a- calm and helpful manner. Um, so I thought you did a really nice job. I think one of the things and I know this is gonna sound like silly but like, acknowledging that there is misbehavior is a huge thing- and not just like blowing through it and ignoring it. Like you have to address it. you did this really nice job of like acknowledging this behavior and attempting to uh, redirect the students back to the conversation. So what I want you to work on for this next simulation is I want you to really think about specific redirections that you can give students. Like being very specific in your language. And if you remember it, there are a couple of times throughout your- um, this first one where you provided like really specific, succinct redirections and behavior change. So even if you think about the last one that you did, like Ethan started talking and you did not let him go very far and you said,   ""Ethan, eyes on me and let's not speak right now."" and then you're able to get right back to your redirections. So that was like top notch. Like it was a really calm voice, it was specific, succinct. And there are other ones, um, where you kind of like engage with the a- with a student about the misbehavior and not like really be specific as to what you wanna have happened. So for example, when Ethan turns or start talking like Darth Vader- Uh, you say, you know, ""Ethan, did you hear what Jasmine just said about not talking or whistling when other people are talking? You have a whole set of rule, what about in this classroom right now?"" So you're kind of engaging him as Darth Vader and like you're trying to get it back to the conversation,- to the roles and expectations, but it never really gets back there. Um, so why do you think is a specific redirection that you could provide Ethan that would help you get back to, um, the norms and expectations? I like it but what's the behavior you wanna have happened? You want him to stop  . So you-- What's something that you could say that would like get him to that? Yeah. ""Ethan, I need you to talk in your regular voice right now."" And if you still wanna engage him, you know, ""Ethan, I-I need you to stop talking like Darth Vader right now, but do you have a classroom norm and expectation that you would like to provide?"" but like you have to like be very specific about behavior that you wanna have- like real quick. Does that make sense? And that's-- I mean, like think about what you did for when he was talking at the end and you're like super specific, ""I need you to be quiet right now."" versus engaging into this-this back of the door. Do you see the difference between the two? So why do you think that we wanna provide like very specific redirections? Behavioral redirections  . Yeah, yeah. I think you're right in all of that. Like, that-that-- Like, we wanna set more time on what like the content-content like the expectations at hand than like fighting back and forth. So let's practice, I'll be a misbehaving student. You can get me back on task. Okay, all right. Yeah. You didn't even have to keep going. Like you need to say, ""Colleen hands like- hands still."" or ""Hand's in your lap."" or however you wanna do it, but you can just do that, the right one. Then, it-- I mean, we want it to be as specific and succinct as possible is what we're-we're- you're going for. Um, so if you wanted them like, you know, ""Hands on the desk."" but can you provide or you know, another example, or ""Let's listen to Jasmine."" or whatever it is, but just try to be as specific and succinct as possible. I'm not really worried about you coming across as like- being like intimidating. That doesn't really seem to fit in with you so-- But like, um, you know, just using your normal, calm voice and not letting things escalate. All right. Is that-- Do you have any questions for me? Okay, all right. You're gonna go back and you're gonna do it another time. Back to beginning like nothing ever happened. Okay. It's is gonna be great. "
transcript,11-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"How do you feel? You feel okay? Yeah. It can be a little frustrating, right? But you did a great job. It's just practice. So, we're gonna use this time right now so you feel a little better when you go back in there. Does that sound good? Okay, cool. Um, so, something that I saw you doing really well, two things really, you were timely in your responses to your redirections, right? You didn't let the behaviors just go on and on. You immediately turned your attention to the student and said, ""Hey, Ethan, you know, could you please, you know, listen?"" Or, you know, ""We're talking right now."" You'd say, ""Ethan, Ethan."" Um, you were specific, too. So some examples of that, um, let's see. You, uh, ba-ba-ba, you said, ""You know, if you're drumming, we can't hear what Savannah is saying,"" right? So you-you would pinpoint the behavior exactly that you wanted them to either do or stop doing and you said things like, ""Make sure you're listening."" Um, so really awesome job with that, because that tells your student exactly what it is that you want them to do. Um, so the one thing that I want you to focus on when you go back in is, um, being a little more succinct with your redirections. So, some of your redirections, again, although they were timely and they were specific, they were a little lengthy. Um, so, for example, when Ethan was doing his Darth Vader voice, you said, ""Excuse me, right now we're talking about expectations. Um, you've got a good Star Wars impersonation, but right now we're talking about expectations. Ethan. Excuse me, Ethan, you're disrupting us right now. Can you please stop talking about Star Wars and video games?"" So, how could you shrink that down? Yeah, exactly. And so why is that-- why is that a better response than kind of that longer one? Yeah, exactly, right? To the point. Um, plus and it doesn't kinda suck up some of your other classroom time, right? You wanna kinda touch-touch base with the student and then move on. Um, so perfect, good. So, what would be-- let's see. Um, okay. With Dev, when Dev was doing his superhero voice, you said, ""Dev, I appreciate your participation, but could you raise your hand, please?"" And then, ""Dev, I'm sorry to cut-- I'm sorry to cut you off. That sounds like a really interesting topic, but right now we're talking about expectations. Do you have anything you'd like to add to that? What about some expectations for the classroom?"" So, how could you make-- how would you make that more succinct? Yeah, so what would you say? Yeah, but make sure-- so you wanna make sure you're naming his behavior too, right? So he's-- when he's talking in a superhero voice, so what could you say to let him know you want to talk about expectations, but you also-- 'cause he could talk about expectations of a superhero, right? So you gotta be careful. Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly. Good. Um, and you wanna make sure that you're-you're steering him away from the superhero talk, right? So, um, I think you said, yeah, ""Right now we're talking about expectations."" And you could even say something like, you know, ""Please don't talk about Plastic Man right now."" Right? Just straight to the point. Um, so okay. So what would-- let's say you have a student and she's tapping on her desk. What would-- what could you say to that? It just happened. Yeah, but watch out when you say, ""Please stop it."" Yeah. Right. You wanna be succinct. Good. God, good. Okay. And so, what would a non-example be of being succinct if someone's tapping on their desk? Yeah, exactly. And so, why is it better to be succinct than kind of a longer- Yeah, exactly. Good. Okay, so we've got one last thing to do. Uh, we're gonna do a little role play. So, I'm gonna pretend to be a student and I want you to use your skills of being succinct, and again keep up with being timely and specific like you were before, um, to redirect me. You ready? Okay. Okay. I knew exactly the behavior that you wanted me to do. Perfect. Okay, very good. Um, okay. Do you have any questions or anything? No? Okay. And I also have to say you were very calm in there, which keep that up. That's-- I know it can be really tough, but you were calm and that really, um, kinda helps facilitate the classroom climate, which is awesome. So, great job with that. Okay. Uh- "
transcript,110-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"So how do you feel? how did you get  - It went okay? Okay and so, hopefully   five minutes to talk about some skills, some things that you can do to make you feel like-- You know, ""it's the best five minutes ever."" Um, so I think you did a really nice job, one thing that I was really happy to see is that you provided really specific feedback and I mean, you know, I kept hearing you say, you know, we're still being silent um,   no drumming, so it's very specific in behaviors  . And so it's really important that interactions are specifics so the students know exactly what you want them to do. Um, so one thing I think that we can do in the next simulation um, is try to work to make your re-directions a little more succinct,um, because sometimes they just took a little but- longer- Than what I think they could. So let's say um- let think about Dev talking about Classic Man. Yeah. So um,  what do you think is uh, one way that you could like make the uh, re-directions succinct? Oh, okay . Oh. Okay. Yeah. So I- yeah I think like being very like succinct and then being like let's relate this to classroom- more, so like very clearly, like naming the action and then where you   h-happen. And so lets's think of another example, uh, so the first time like you- we started and Ethan's making those voices- or something like that. Uh, so what is a way that you could respond that is specific and succinct to um, Ethan making noise? Yeah, I think you can do that, you seem very hesitant with that, like- No, I think that, you know, they're tons of different ways you can do succinct. You know you can do, ""Ethan please be quiet,"" you know, succinct doesn't have to be harsh, you know? So, I don't want you to like conflict those ideas but like, ""Please be quiet"" or ""Ethan""- you know and that's one way that's just- you can get right back to it, things like that. So, why do you think it's like a good idea to use these like succinct- Yeah, yeah and I think because it like- it can also can just like change the whole attitude of the classroom too, and you're just like spending so long talking about these things that you don't- and I think you even said at the end about classrooms, I haven't heard from Savannah and Ethan yet just because it takes so much time. So I think providing those specific succinct-  Okay. Do we-- how long do we have? Great, so let's do, would you do a bit of role playing? I will be an off task student um, and you can practice different ways to um, make me  . Yes. I should have a little fun   all right. So-  Yeah. So it's addressing it right away, it's being very specific- um, and succinct   right back into   you know, so they can   expectations. So, just saying it over a really nice, calm voice- which he didn't seem to get very riled  in the last one. So, just take that approach and- you know, ""Please, be quiet,""and more  . Okay. Do you have any questions or- Okay. Right. You wanna try another way? Or you- Okay, all right. Um, good, so we're going to focus on specific, succinct, ""be quiet"", voices off, ""listen silently-"" those things. Okay? All right. "
transcript,111-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"So how do you feel of that? Not great? Well that's okay. It's just for practice, and so we will use this time right now to hopefully make you feel a little bit better for the next time you go back in for those last five minutes. Um, but at least- yeah it just works. Yeah, sorry. Um, so one thing that I saw you doing really well was you're really timely with your redirections, so you made eye contact with the students and you were you know, would say their names specifically, which would signal to them that, you know, you knew what they were doing was off task, so that's a really really excellent start to, um, having redirections for students. Um, so let's see for instance probably having   was taken in time. Um, you know, for instance, you know, when Ethan was doing impersonations you said, ""Ethan, Ethan."" You know, you would say his name a couple times to get his attention. So again, really really good start. You didn't let the behavior go, you weren't ignoring it. Um, and so definitely like the fact that you weren't ignoring it is great because then it's kinda showing that you're getting ready to really kinda nip it in the bag there. Um, so what I want you do for this next simulation when you go in. I want you to practice being a little more succinct, or sorry, a little more specific in your redirections. Um, so when you're specific it allows your students, or you're telling your students exactly what it is that you want them to do or to stop doing for that matter. Um, and so there's really no ambiguity in that. So, let's say, um-- So that's here. I'll go back to the- the impersonation. You know, when Ethan was doing his Trump impersonation. You said, ""Ethan, Ethan, you know I don't want to keep reminding you to follow the rules. Um, Ethan we're trying to talk about the rules, the important rules that when you're on task or paying attention."" So, you said paying attention, but what- how could you maybe change that- to be specific so he knows exactly what you want him to do? Right. Yup. Yeah. No   No voice-voice is off, um, anything like that. So then why is that do you think better than, um, saying something like, ""We're paying attention. We're trying to pay attention."" Yeah exactly, right? You wanna be specific and observable. Perfect. Um, so let's see, um, when-- let's see. Oh, okay so when Ethan was drawing,- again you said, ""Ethan, Ethan, um, you know, what's the rule that we just established? It was listening to the teacher, so we want to keep following that rule, um, even when the teachers are talking make sure you have respect."" and he said that he was being respectful, and you said, ""Are you?"" and, um, so what's- what's the word   that you think was maybe a little ambiguous? Yeah. All right. Yeah. I know. They're good at doing that. So what- what could you say there? So he's sitting there and he's drumming, what could you say to him that would be more specific? Yeah, right? ""Ethan, please stop drumming."" He knows exactly the behavior that you're looking for there. Good, and so again, why is that better than, you know, saying ""Let's have respect."" Right, it means something very specific. Awesome. Um, okay. So, let's say, um, how is it bothering you? No, no you're good. So let's say one of the students starts whistling, um, what- what would you say if the student was whistling? Okay, good. What would a- what would a non example be of being specific? Yeah, right. Why is that a non example? Yeah, exactly. It's not being specific. It's not giving that absorbable measurable action. Perfect. Okay, so what we're gonna do now is a little bit of a role play. I'm going to be- Perfect. I'm gonna be the off task student and I want you to be specific in your redirections, and again keeping with being timely of what you were doing, um in redirecting me. Ready? So I was at the beach this weekend and it was really awesome. Whatever it's like perfect out. Okay. Yeah. Good, um, perfect. So- and again you were specific. I knew exactly what you wanted me to do, um, and it was, uh, objective and measurable. Perfect. Okay, so how do you feel? You ready? Yeah. Um, but I'm actually not gonna- I'm not gonna try you this time. I'm gonna have you wear it just for the sake of consistency, but I'm not gonna plug in this time so it's cool. You got this. I'm excited to see the specific timing here. "
transcript,112-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"You can come and have a seat over here. You can have a- have a seat, and we'll chat. You're gonna have to wear that again for the next one. Even though I'm not gonna speak into it. Okay, so tell me how you um- feel. You're not doing that, Ethan. Okay. Wait, so you didn't do anything wrong, but you didn't do anything thing right, so you just feel like you just did things? Yeah. So, I think you did a nice job, you know, like, what you're saying, like, addressing, the misbehavior every time, which is, like, really important to do. But I think one thing that we are gonna talk about, um, is, like, providing really specific feedback, and I think that you kinda felt like, you kept, like, building up to it, um, a couple of times, but it took a long time to get there. So, if you're thinking about, like, the Def with Mr Fantastic, would you engage, like, back and forth, back and forth. Like, why are you sorry? ""I'm sorry that I interrupt you with your conversations."" You're engaging with him with this. And then you lose time about what you actually want to do. Does that make sense? So, you wanna think about providing cues that are really specific, and succinct to, um, the- the misbehavior. So, for, example, and that Def is talking with- or talking to Savannah- she's not really talking back, um, about Mr Fantastic. You wanna provide a redirection before it escalates too much, and you lose too much of your class time. So you're thinking, like, ""Def, we're not talking about superheroes, right now."" Move on, you know, so you can   really think. Like, why do you think that would be a little bit more effective? Yeah. Yeah. So, and you wanna think about this, like, you know, how much- how much time do you wanna spend-- Uh- well, yeah. Well, even, like, redirecting to get back to norms and expectations. Right. You know, in this, it's five minutes, but even in the classroom, like, you're still gonna want, like, less amount of time   for re-directions. So, if you can provide very specific, succinct, um, re-directions, you could have more time. Even thinking about the time that, um, Ethan was, like, drawing on the desk. Like, you're like, ""Stop dancing."" He was like, ""I'm not dancing, I'm drummin'."" You know, like? Right, but it still, like, that specific thing, like, click with him. And making Will have those middle school students that, like, look for those really specific, like, ""Here's the line. I'm gonna go right up to it, I'm gonna put my toe on it, and what are you gonna do?"" You know, so it's, like, dancing or drumming? So, providing that specific, ""This is the line, don't cross it."" Right? Does that make sense? Okay. Um, so, providing succinct, like, cues. Let's practice. I'll be a non-test student, and I want you to provide specific, succinct feedback. Real short. Okay? All right.  Jenny, do you wanna go over for lunch? That's good. So, it's really specific, really succinct. One thing we'll have to watch is, when you are providing these types of feedback is that y-you don't want to, like, escalate the situation with your tone. So it's still, like, real calm. Like there's-there's like a difference between ""Collin, we're not talking about this right now."" And, like, ""Collin, please stop talking to  ."" You know, so, you have to be really careful about that. 'Cause, like, when you're being succinct, you don't want it to come across as, like, you know what I mean? I'll come back to you, don't worry.  But just be really careful about that. So, it's-it's addressing this behavior which you did really well in the first one, but it's being very-- Yeah. Well, it's not- it's not perfect, it's, like, being succinct in your re-directions. You're not engaging them in this back and forth, as to like, ""Well, why are you doing this? Tell me all of these things."" You wanna get back to the topic at hand, and this, you know, example, it's norms and expectations, but it could be the economy, it could be opportunity cost, whatever it is, but y-you wanna get back to it. Does that make sense? Do you have any questions for me? Okay. Yes, you need to read it again, and you're back in for 5 minutes, and it's like nothing ever happened, you're back at the beginning. "
transcript,113-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"Yeah, how are you feeling about that? Well, that's good. Yeah-yeah, you wanna get the parts of, like- Yeah. Yeah. Well, with-- we'll track off some things that will help you make it feel like comfortable- the realm of  bossy and not bossy. Um, so   did a really nice job, like, providing specific redirections to the students. I'm thinking, like, especially in the last time, like, Ethan started making noises, like, you were right there, like, saying, ""Voice is off, Ethan,"" and, like, he was quiet and he even Johnson thought that was really nice giving, like, these specific redirections. Um, so, w-what we really kind of talk about- during this little coaching session, um, is, um, providing, like, more succinct redirections- Um, because sometimes in, like, they just went a little bit long. So, I'm getting back the first time- like, their redirections. It took a while to, like, that one, like, yeah, get there. Um, so, the thing that I'm giving out the first time that Ethan was-- I think he was, like, making video game noises, or making some sort of a noise, um, and he-- so he's making all this noise, so what is a way that you think you could, um, provide redirection that is very, like, specific and succinct to Ethan to get him back on-on task. Yeah. So, you say, I'm just gonna add, I just wanna -- like when you say that one thing, like, what was- was that- what's an example of that one thing you would say? Yeah, yeah. I think that's really good. Like, if you're-you name behavior that you want to end, and so I think things like the-the ""Voice is off"" or ""We're listening to Dave, we need you to be quiet."" Because if you-- Sometimes if you just say that, ""We're listening to Dev,"" If you have a cone, right? Like, ""Well, I can listen while I'm talking."" Yeah. So make sure that you're naming behavior- that you want to have happened. Then in a sense it's specific and then it's like  like, um-- Why do you think it's better that we do those, like, succinct, specific redirections? Yeah, yeah, I think you're right on with that. With Ethan, like, it's five minutes here within the class time, like, how much  uh, in that, so I think- Right. Right. Right. Um, so we can do a little bit of-of role-playing, and you can try out some different things, so I'll be your really annoying student, in fact making a lot of noise, and you can practice different ways on how to make sure that I'm-I'm quiet and paying attention in all tasks. Right.  Okay. Yeah, it's- I mean think you got it so it's specific, it's succinct, um, and you can just say it in a nice, calm-calm manner. , any questions or--? Yeah, they can see you. So, and that's another thing you can- you can think about, you know, in doing non-verbals too and that's, you know, it's very specific, just being like Ethan. Yeah, yeah, you can totally do that. Yeah, they can see that. But just make sure that it's, like, it's specific and that- and that you can't interpret, like, it in multiple ways, like so. Yeah, this is where  . 12. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Was it then quiet kindly or-- . No, just me.  So now, um, so this next one, I'm not going to be talking to you in your ear, do you want her to wear the thing so if you could still wear it-- And-and then- we'll get back in it. Great. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be restarting as- if they don't know."
transcript,115-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"And so, how do you feel about that one? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, I mean, you wanna let it go 'cause you don't want it to, like-- Right. Exactly. You want- You want to have control- of the classroom. Um, you don't- No matter what else is happening there- You know, like, you're still able to accomplish what you want to accomplish. And so, I think you did a really nice job and throughout the whole thing and you kept calm- the whole time. Um, I could tell you weren't, like, at first, like, getting frustrated for sure. Um, but you know, you stayed calm the entire time, every time that there's a misbehavior. You know, you were very timely with it really- like, right on-on with it. Um, so one thing that we're gonna focus on over the next couple of minutes, um, is really providing specific feedback. Um, the students don't really have them, like, redirected- that you, um, the task at hand. Um, so one thing that I noticed, um, in your-- So le-let's look, um, back at the, um- Okay. The superhero, where Dev's talking about- a superhero. So you- It kinda goes on for a while. About Plastic Man. And I don't know if you were, like, waiting for- some connection. But-- Yeah. So you-you really wanna, like, provide that really- Period. But you need to be very specific. Like, when do you get to the point, like, okay, you know, you can let this go, like, a little bit- but once you can tell this is not really into class. Yeah. And saying, you know, very specifically be like, ""Dev, we're not talking about superheroes right now- we are talking about classroom norms."" Too long. Okay. And why did it, like, when you were talking, you're really gonna- You don't wanna be too harsh or anything- like that. That's gonna come from your tone. And so, that's something that you always have to keep in mind as, you know, there's a difference between- the sets. Um, so the next time that a student is misbehaving, I want you to be very specific with what you want them to do. So for example, um, if a student is- banging on the desk, I want you to say, ""Please stop banging."" And just real quick, very specific- very sustained. And then move right back. Yeah. And so then that way-- Why do you think you wanna give really specific behavioral redirections? Tell me more about setting the tone for everybody there. Yeah, and think about- Let's think about, like, what a, like, a non example- of a specific- A non- A non-specific redirection to a student. So if you're just saying, like, if you really- If you just say, like, attention on me- or something like that, you're not naming the behavior outside. So- And you don't even- It's not even a calling out. You know what? It's- calling out the behavior. So it's- If you're just saying, you know, ""I need to have attention on me."" W-What does that look like? What is behavior that you actually want to have stop. So if the student's banging, you're addressing the bang. So you're being really, really specific about it. Does that make sense? Um, so why do you think, like, that's good, like, to really name the behavior? Yeah, and I also think there is no room for interpretation. And you know you- you've been with middle schoolers, like-Love them. And I love them, too. But, like, they will take- When you give them an inch- Exactly. So you wanna be really specific- with your redirections. Okay? So if I'm an off task student we'll practice, you can redirect me. Okay, you ready? Lada lada lada lada lada lada-- Well, remember, that's-that's really general. So you wa-- What was behavior that I was doing that you want-- Yeah. Singing-ish. So you can, say, call me. Yeah. Stop the singing. Until you've named the behavior. Okay. Do you have any questions for me? Okay. So be really specific while still being calm. Um, and that's what- That's what we're gonna do in this next five minutes. Okay? All right, you're back in."
transcript,116-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"So how do you feel about that first one? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Well, hopefully, we'll give you like some-some tools of like-- You'll then be able to like set those so you can go into the setting expectations and the rules and expectations. So um, one thing that I noticed and that I was really happy with is like you acknowledged the behavior So what I wanna talk about over the next couple of minutes is how we can provide um behavioral feedback that is like specific and succinct and so hopefully it will limit the amount of time you spend talking about it versus actually doing what you wanna do. Um, so I'm gonna-- We're gonna talk about a couple of specific um, instances from the simulation and we'll talk about maybe ways that you could handle it um, in the second one. Um, so this time what I really want you to focus on is on specific redirections to make simulation here stronger. Thinking about the time that Ethan goes into like the Darth Vader voice. Um, during it you say like, ""One rule is we should raise our hands and   Ethan keeps going and you're saying, ""We can talk about this during lunch."" and it's kind of like this really long um, back and forth. So the next time that like a student is doing something or talking about a topic that's not what you wanna be doing, I want you to provide specific redirection. So for example, you could do, ""Ethan, we're gonna use our regular voice in the classroom."" and then you can like you specifically addressed that. Um, so why may you wanna use something like, ""Ethan we're gonna use our regular voices."" versus engaging him in these conversations? Yeah, yeah it's like a concrete actually, I totally agree with you. Um, I think it-- Because when you're engaging them in these conversations you're taking more time away from what's happening in the classroom and you're not really providing that specific, ""What is it you actually wanna have happen?"" So if he keeps going back, you'll go, ""Well, let's go back to rule number one."" That's more time, that's more you know, energy wasted in that way versus you just address specific misbehavior in a very succinct way like you can move on with it. Does that make sense? Okay. I would. Yeah, because you wanna acknowledge this behavior and especially if you think about it, it's the first day of school and you wanna set these expectations so it's like students are gonna constantly like be pushing you. So if they-- So you start it like having that clear firm thing, to begin with they know what their expectations are and it can take you know just really-you can do it very quickly. So even just going, ""Ethan."" You've addressed in his behavior and hopefully, you can get back to the instruction. Instead of getting into like a larger conversation, that's what we're gonna try to avoid. Does that make sense? All right, so let's do a little role-playing. My name is Colleen in case you forget. I'm gonna be a misbehaving student and you can- and you can help redirect my misbehavior, okay? Yeah. Yeah, so. Yeah, that's it. So and address it like right away. Just be like, ""Colleen, please stop drumming."" or ""Colleen, hands off the desk."" Something like that, that tells me exactly what you wanted to have happen, it's really quickly, and you don't-it-- As long as you say it in this calm tone, you're not like, ""Raaah."" You know, so just, you know, ""Please stop drumming."" You can move on and keep going so does that make sense? Okay, do you have questions for me? Okay, all right um, so we're at the end of our 5 minutes. So you're gonna go back in and do this again. Okay? So just think about everything. Those specific redirections that we talked about, okay? All right. "
transcript,118-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"So how do you feel at class? Interesting? Tell me more. Um- you mean it was hard when- when I would- Well, I won't be doing that for the next ones, so you'll have you, one have me in your head like a Jiminey Cricket. Um- sorry that was a little unwavered. Yeah. Yeah. Throws you off a little bit. Yeah. Um- well, one thing that I will say that you did a really great job with was being specific. Um- so, you know, even when I- when I wasn't kind of chiming into your ear, I'm gonna pull up a couple of examples. Um- when Dave started talking about superheroes to Savannah, uh- what did you say- you said um- ""Dave, Dave, you know, we're talking about why teacher's don't like technology in the classroom. Dave- Dave no side conversations we're talking as a whole group."" And so that was great because you named his behavior that you wanted to stop immediately, right? 'Cause conversation was what you wanted to stop. So that was fantastic. Um- and then again, one later when Ethan was doing his Trump impersonation which was so silly, right- you against that, you know. Ethan had his back   to cellphones, ""Are we still on topic?"" And then you went to name it specifically. You said ""Okay, thank you Ethan. We're not talking about that right now, we're talking about rules."" Right? And so you we're being specific with what you wanted him to do or just stop doing. So, that was really awesome um- that's so important because it's specific and observable, so the students know exactly what it is you were referring to. There's no in argue with either um- which is awesome. And so, what's I- what's the wait- what I noticed in this last simulation session is that although you were specific and timely, where you didn't let these behaviors go on and on, um- you're- less interjections become a little succinct, so just kind of shortening the amount of time you're spending giving that redirection, um- this is really important 'cause in it can have- it'll help the class just move on really quickly, right? So, and you- um- kinda similar to the examples I just gave you, I think it was yeah- so for at the Trump impersonation one, you said ""How does that relate to cellphones?"" ""Are we staying on topic?"" And then you kind of continued- You know you were listening, and then you said ""Okay, Ethan, thank you. Ethan, we're not talking about that right now, we're talking about rules."" So, I just want you to kinda shorten it up to like that last part that you did there was perfect. You didn't need all of the other stuff. Right   stopped 'cause you're putting your thoughts together. Um- but- so, let's say- let's say Ethan, um- is talking like Trump again. What- what can you say to him that would be succinct to redirection? Oh, yeah. Let me ask you this quest- Oh, go ahead. To stay with him- He might then still talk, right? So could you say something like "" Ethan, I- Ethan, please talk about classroom rules."" Right? 'Cause that's specifically naming the exact kinda rules and then it's not kind of going on and on, it's just, ""Ethan, we're talking about classroom rules."" And if he continue still- let's say now he's talking about classroom rules in a Trump voice but he's on topic, what could you say to him? Yeah, great. Just, ""Please use your normal voice."" Yeah, just as simple as that,   overthink these things. Um- yeah, so, just using those normal voice. So just say, what if um- let's say Dave starts talking about superheroes again, what's a succinct redirection you can give him? That's okay. Yup, yeah, so Im excited to see the succinct in there, um- you'll be great. I'm gonna have to keep that on just for the sake of consistency, but I'm not gonna   in. Sorry, I should've told you that on the table."
transcript,12-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"What did you think, how you feel? Yeah. So I think you did a really nice job, um, like with the redirections and I think, you know, if you can remember-- I know it's like really hard even though you just went through it. So I think about like what works and what didn't work. One thing that you did really well, um, was that you provided very specific feedback to Ethan and you provided that specific feedback to Ethan. And to Dave, it- it fixed behavior like pretty quickly. And so a couple of times, you know, like you said, Dave starts to talking about Mr. Fantastic and you said, ""Dave, let's cut the side conversation,"" and he immediately goes, ""Oh, okay."" And he stops. Um, or, um, like even at the beginning when I was writing those ques, like very specifically, ""What do you want to have happened?"" The one thing that we're gonna talk about this next couple minutes is providing feedback that's succinct. So a lot of times, it took you a while to get to that specific feedback. So this last one when Ethan was impersonating Trump, you say, you know, ""We're just talking about being respectful and that extends to me. I need you to listen,"" and you're going all of these things and Ethan is still impersonating Trump. And then, um, like when you get back to the-- you tried to say, ""No side conversations, please,"" and then it stops. So let's-- So you see what I'm saying, like- you want to be like-- 'Cause you want to spend more time on, like, what you want to spend time on, not like every direction. So let's think of some ways if a student is to be misbehaving, as to like what are some, um, succinct ways you could redirect their behavior? And so let's say that, um, just like a- a student is-- I can't think of [inaudible  right now. I don't know why. He's tapping on the desk. Like, what are some things that you could say to redirect their behavior? So I think when you're saying like, the, the pencils down, or the stop tapping- I like those because those are specific. But if you're doing like, broad like, pay attention- what is it about behavior that you wanna have happened? You want-- Like paying attention, but yeah. You'd be like, ""I'm paying attention-"" ""but--"" Yes. So then, like-- So if you're providing that specific feedback which you have always eventually did- but providing it, like, succinctly at the, like, forefront. Does that make sense? So why do you think we want to provide, um, succinct feedback? Like, what's the benefit of it? Yeah. Well, yeah. It really happens to all of us, you know, that you go back and forth but if you can think about providing those succinct things and you're absolutely right, then it gives more time back to the task at hand, setting the norms and expectations or, you know, when you're into content like talking about opportunity costs- or something like that. Um, [inaudible  get you back on track. So what would a non-example of a succinct redirection be? So what would that look like? What would that sound like? Yeah. We really get long winded in there- and I think you're- you're right on there. So let's practice. Um, I will be an off-task student and you can redirect my behavior. Hey, Rose. Do you wanna [inaudible ? Yes. Yeah. It was gonna be bagels.  Yeah. And when you're doing this, this is not like coming at you or like how you said it. It's just something they think about is that sometimes when people like say succinct things, it can come across as like harsh. And you're not a harsh person- at all, but just always, like, make sure, you know, you're thinking about like there's a clear difference between- no side conversations and like, no side conversations. You know? So just be . So-- But you have any questions for me? Okay, great. You are back in for five minutes. Um, yeah, that thing back in. I will not be annoying you in your ear."
transcript,120-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,4,"How do you feel? Good. We good. I guess it's, uh-- Yes, I can. Thank you. Uh, yes, how do you feel about that? Mm-hmm. Yes. No, I can know it was a great strategy, that was really- really great. Um, and yeah, you, uh-huh, seemed very confident in there, which is-which is great. Um, so, one of the things that I saw you consistently doing actually-- I saw you do it-- In the number of things consistently, um, you were really timely in your responses. We named at once a, um, behavior started to occur you immediately, turned your attention to it. Uh, you were of succinct and that's, um, or like you were-- You were s-s-specific I should say, and that you've said exactly what is was that you wanted to see the student doing or not doing. Um, and you were succinct, and that you kept your redirections pretty, um, pretty short, so they don't really drag on. Um, so, that was really outstanding. Outstanding work with that. Um, these are all very, very important aspects of giving redirections just to doing, so, you hit the nail on the hat at this. Nice work. Um, so, let's see, one thing that I noticed, um, was your body language and your tone. Um, on top of being really, really awesome at the other things and-and you did a great job on remaining calm, 'cause sometimes there was behaviors kind really kind of feel like ""uh"". Um, you're great job remaining calm, and you said words like ""please"" afterwards, it was excellent as well. It really helps with your classroom climate. Um, but I wanna try to work on your body language and your tone just to kind of lighten it up a little bit. Um, so-- And this is important because it-it kind of eases the tension with your students, and, um, kind of put them that eases well as yourself. It's then kind of keep things rolling through the class, just good. Um, so, let's say, uh, let's see. Let's say-- Okay, back to one of the   click every year. Um, so, when Dev was talking about the superhero? Um, let's say he starts talking about the superhero, how could you respond him in a way that's, um, calm and has kind of a positive demeanor about it? Um, when he starts talking about that. Yeah. It's-- Yeah. Mm-hmm. That was a really tough one. Um, that's definitely a tough one. So, let's-let's look at the behavior on that one just in and out of itself. Did you want him to talk about the superhero? Yeah. To tight back in? Okay. Yeah. Right. Perfect. I love that you said ""Can we talk about classroom rules now?"", right? Because then, you're-- When you originally said that you say, ""Can we talk about this?""- which is kind of vague, right? Can you a little objective? Um, but we're talking about classroom rules specifically that your student know exactly, like, you choose on the target with. So, perfect. Um, what about when, uh, let's see, when Ethan was drumming, and he started banging. Um, what could you do in a-- That would be a-a positive calm manner to redirection there? Perfect. Perfect. Yeah. See how your voice is a little bit- lighter? Um, and-and I know how easy it is to get a little stressed out when you're in our [inaudible . Keep it like that, that's perfect. Awesome. Okay, so we're gonna do a quick role play, um, I'm gonna be one of your students, and I want you to redirect me using a calm, um, positive manner. Are you ready? Okay. Perfect. Yeah. And remember, keep it up succinct, um, clicking to the point just like you were doing before- so, you might keep up with those things but-- Perfect. All right, how do you feel? Ready to go back in? Okay. Awesome. "
transcript,122-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"First of all, how do you feel? How do you think that went? Okay. So, what made it more difficult? Mm-hmm, okay. How'd you feel though? Okay, all right. Well, on the whole, I mean I thought you maintained your calm, which was awesome even when some of the things kept going, didn't notice any instance of like frustration, you know, sort of a visible, you know, crinkle of the face, none of that, which was I think awesome. And those first couple pieces of feedback, you know when those first three happened, you know, what happened when I gave you those suggestions in the earbuds? Well, that's a little robotic but in term-but in terms of behavior specifically, what happened when you explicitly gave some of those redirections? Yeah, behavior stopped. And so-so that was great. So, I noticed-- first of all, that you've noticed some behavior later on too about when Ethan was whistling or he was talking to somebody else or Dev was a little off task and so the-- You're noticing it, you're offering some specific suggestions, which is awesome. And so, what I want to do is focus just this little coaching conversation on how we can be a little bit more specific more often, and then just maintain that sense of calm. Sound good? All right. So, let's take for example when Dev was talking about Plastic Man. And so, what could be a specific and a succinct way to respond to Dev in that situation? Mm-hmm. Think of specific enough. What what do you think? So, if you were Dev-- What are you trying to do is the instructor, what do you want Dev to do? Right. And so you understand task. Yeah. And so-and so being specific with naming the behavior. Uh, ""You know, Dev, that's a-that's an off-task question right now or that's an off-topic question. Thank you for asking it, but I'm gonna ask you to hold that, or please hold that while we continue to talk about rules."" So, you know, instead of pushing it off to, you know, ""We'll talk about it at a later time or whatever,"" you know, just name the behavior. So, ""Dev that's an off ask question. We're not on that topic right now,"" and then give him an action you know, please, you know, at-- you know, stay on topic or answer my questions with that. So, it's being specific with naming the behavior so that he knows sort of what's going on and then giving them an action set about what to do, you know, which would be to stay on task and not ask, you know, those kinds of questions right now. Does that make sense? Okay. So, let's say-- Let's try a different example. Let's say that you observe-- you know, you're teaching and all of a sudden you see- you see this. And those little card in the simulator, but you see-when you see this. So, how could you be specific and succinct with the redirection? Okay. So, let's say my name is Mike. How could you make that more specific? Okay, great. All right. So, name the behavior. So your phone-- Put your phone away and then you mash the action in there as well. So again, trying to be as specific as possible. Because when a student sort of acts out in class, what do they really want? Yeah, they want attention. And so by using that name connection, you sort of satisfy that desire of, ""Oh my gosh. I was noticed."" And then, you offer them the redirection and they get that little, you know, that little hit of like, ""Oh my gosh. I was noticed and I got some attention."" But then, you know they get back to what they were doing. So what would a non-response look like? So, if I was doing this from your end with a non-response look like? From you, from you. You let it happen. And then, what potentially could happen? Right. Yes, so it could snowball out of control. And so, that's why it's important to hit these early on so that active scanning, you know, which I saw in a couple of sisters, which is awesome. Just make sure you maintain that active scanning before as you just mentioned if things could potentially go out of control, okay. All right. So, let's say I'm also Mike and I turn to Rose and I start talking to Rose and I start whispering. What could you say? So- Okay. How can we be more succinct? More succinct. Uh-huh, okay. So that makes-- So that gives him an action. And you could also do redirection. Yeah. How about just Mike voices off eyes on me? I mean just real simple. So, you're asking him to stop that and then you're asking him to physically redirect. So it's those two action steps. So, Mike voices off, eyes on me. You know, real simple. Okay. Sounds good? How are you feeling? Well, sure. I'm excited to see you do it, too. All right. Are you ready? All right. Part two. You're gonna leave it in but I'm gonna respond to fewer if any. Just depending on how things go. Sounds good? Okay, great. "
transcript,123-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"Um, so how do you feel about that first simulation there? No. That's not gonna be a dinging. It's not gonna be unit-- That's not gonna be a unit feedback in terms of dinging. Um, but that aside, how do you feel about it? Okay. Well, just for practice. So let's kind of focus right now on, uh, another skill for- so when go back in, you kind of feel better about going back in about it. Okay? Um, so one thing that I saw you- that you did an awesome job with was that you were really timely. Um, so you always recognized when a behavior was occurring. Like, when Ethan was drumming, you would say, ""Okay, let's be quiet,"" right? So you were recognizing, um, and telling him that his behavior was inappropriate in some way there. Um, so you did a really great job with that. So this time I want you to focus on being specific in your feedback, um, to make the simulation even stronger. So, for example, um, when, who was it? Dev was talking about the superhero and you would say, um, you were very timely that you would respond to his conversation and you said, ""Okay, that's, you know, that's not important right now, that's going off topic."" Um, I want you to be more specific, though. So what you could do next time is just say, ""Okay, Ethan, voice off,"" right? So you could just be voice off or what's another thing that you could do to redirect him? Okay. So you kind of bring him back, but if you wanna give him specific feedback on exactly what you want him to do, right? You want to be very precise, what could you say? Okay. Yeah, right. So it doesn't-- We could say, um, so it was actually Dev that was talking about the superhero, ""Um, Dev, please stop talking about superheroes."" Right? Just very direct to the point, ""Dev, please stop talking about superheros."" Okay? Um, so how was that different than just saying, ""Dev, that's off topic.""? Yeah, precisely. So you're giving them a very specific direction of what they should or shouldn't be doing in reference to their current behavior. Okay, great. Um, so what we're gonna do now is a little practice. Um, so I'm gonna pretend to be an off-task student and I want you to use that strategy that we just talked about, you know, being specific to redirect me. Okay, are you ready? Okay. So I went to the beach this weekend and it was so awesome. Good, good. So what was different about that from what you were doing before? Definitely, yeah. So this time what you did was you named exactly what you wanted me to stop doing or what you wanted me to start doing. Um, perfect . Okay, well, I'm so excited to see you being more specific in the next simulation. Um, do you have any questions or anything before you go back in? Okay. "
transcript,124-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"So how do you feel? What do you think? Yeah, but I- like, you woul- like, we're looking in-in everything and stuff. But like you did a really nice job, like stopping behaviors, you know? Like they kept coming up like, but like this is what happens in a classroom. You know, they're gonna keep coming up. But you did a nice job addressing behaviors, it's just like, you have to have confidence that like you can keep doing it, like-- Yeah. So just, just keep steady. Like you did a really nice job, like when you addressed behaviors of what you were saying. I mean, we can like, we'll break it down. It's like, what worked and-and things like that. But have confidence, and just like, keep going and I know that it like, can get really annoying and being like, ""I have to constantly do this."" But, like-- Exactly. You have to, like, it's just-it's- you know, kids need that, like- that reminder. So, you did a really nice job, like you addressed every misbehavior. Which sounds like a small thing, but it's not a small thing. Um, and- so, A lot of times, like, there are some things that you said that like, worked really well, and you- like you noticed, right? When the behavior ended? You noticed it. You got it sometimes. Uh, so what made that like, we're gonna talk on- like, when you-when you did that. It's really nice that you provided really specific feedback. And some students know exactly what you wanted to do. So for example, when Ethan was whistling, like you said, ""Ethan, I need you to stop making noise."" and then you said it in a really nice, calm voice and it was very clear this is what you need to have happened. It was really specific, and you like, were able to get right back into everything. So that's awesome, like that's- it's like really good. And so then what we're gonna talk about is sometimes making it more-- Like your redirections succinct. So you have those times where you're like, ""Ethan I need you to stop whistling,"" and then when Ethan starts talking like Darth Vader. You start engaging in this back and forth like, ""I'm not sure,"" so, like Ethan says, you know, ""We have Jedi knights."" ""I'm not sure if what you're saying is related. I need you to focus on these things, um, 'cause I'm focused on Luke."" and you kept trying to engage him when he was Darth Vader, instead of like ending, um- at the beginning. So, if when you provide- So let's think about-- In that example of where Ethan is acting like Darth Vader. How could you redirect that behavior? Or provide a specific succinct, like a-a short way to-- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. So I think if you say like, ""I need your focus up here,"" that can be interpreted in multiple ways. 'Cause he could keep talking like Darth Vader and-- ""I'm focused."" Right. You know? So you wanna provide really specific-- What is behavior that you want to have happen? Or you want to stop happening? Yeah. Perfect. ""Ethan, I need you to stop imitating Darth Vader."" Like that's-- It's really clear what it is, and then you can say, you know, ""Do you have, uh, norm and expectation?"" or something like that. If you wanna engage him that way, but you need to end the behavior first. So providing that like really specific redirection is really important. And you did that a couple of times throughout, um, but sometimes it just took you like a while to get to those, um, specific- . Does that make sense? Okay. All right. So let's practice. All right. So, I am gonna be a misbehaving student. My name's Coleen, if you forget it, and you can, uh, practice redirecting me. Okay? All right.  Yeah. That's great. Like that's right on, really specific. Uh, and it was like, succinct. No messing around. Okay? You feel okay about that? You seem a little hesitant about it. I want you to try. I just want you to try. I want you to think about being really specific in your feedback. Okay? All right? Like, y-- I want you just try it, you know? You've gotta try different things. See what works out. Okay? So, provide these specific, um, feedback. Okay? Yes. Yes. Okay. Naming this behavior that you wanna have happen. Okay? All right. Um, so, you're gonna go back in, and it's like, nothing happened. Okay? So you're back at the very beginning. Starting all over again. Okay, questions? Okay. Who-- "
transcript,13-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"Alright. So how did you feel about that? Who is he that you're talking about? Okay, okay. Um, okay. So how do you feel that you handled him? Oh, well, I wish you wouldn't feel that way. Um, but we're gonna use this time right now to kind of make you feel better about it so when you go back in, hopefully, you're a little more prepared. Um, one thing that I saw that you did that was really stellar was you gave timely redirections. Um, and so the reason this is so important is because it minimizes the amount of time that students are gonna be engaging in a specific or a certain behavior. Right? So you're recognizing that, there is a misbehavior that's occurring and you're signaling to the student, ""Hey, whatever you're doing right now, you should not be engaging in."" Um, and that's so, so important when you're giving redirections. Um, so really, really awesome job with that. Um, one thing that I want you to work on for this next time is being a little more specific in your redirection. Um, so let me-- I'm just   typing before. Um, I took some notes on certain things that you said, uh, that I think are, um, really great examples of being timely, but, um, not necessarily- or that you could improve on with being specific. So when Ethan was talking in his Darth Vader voice, right? It sounded kind of silly. Um, you did a really great job of responding to him and you were trying to redirect him. You said, ""So again, Ethan, if you have a comment, um, we're going to raise our hands. If you raise your hand, I will call on you."" And then, of course- he raises his hand, you know. He found that little loophole, he raises his hand, he continues talking like Darth Vader. Um, and then you kind of moved back, you said, ""All right, does anyone else have a comment about how they'd like our classroom to feel?"" And you asked Jasmine. Um, so next time if- I want you to be more specific with that. So how could you have been more specific with your redirection to- to Ethan when he was talking like Darth Vader? Yeah. Be careful with that though. Because, um, you're totally on the right track, but his comments weren't necessarily off task, right? It was the way he was saying. He was kind of being silly. So how can you be even more specific to get at that precise behavior? You could have- So you could have taken it that way, but that probably actually would have kept him- talking like Darth Vader. We kind of want them to steer away- from that. So what you could have done is just said, ""Ethan, please talk in your regular voice."" Right? It seems, I know. It seems like, well, okay. But, um, yeah. You can just- and it's- you're saying ""please"". Right? So please talk in your regular voice. So how is that better than kind of trying to say, ""Okay, what would, you know, what would the dark side do?"" or something like that. Yeah, exactly, exactly. Um, you're just- you're naming his behavior right there so there's no ambiguity. Um, so let's say, let's see, let's say Ethan is doing impersonations again, right? He was acting like Mario- at the end. How could you give him a specific response to that? So he's-- Okay. I can read you the scenario that I wrote down. Um, so he was talking like- and you said Mario. Um, and you said, ""Ethan, I've spoken to you many times. Um, I'd love for you to be able to tell us what you- what your thought is on how to make our conversation- or sorry, how to make- how to make our classroom a place they want to be."" And then he continued with his impersonation and you said, ""Ethan. Ethan,"" which, again, is that timely response, like, you're acknowledging the fact that he's not on task and he's not talking  Oh. That was a quick five minutes. Okay. Um, okay. So I'm excited to see you be specific when you go back in, um, and keep up being timely. That was a really, really- great job. Okay? Okay, awesome. You feel good about going back in? All right. "
transcript,14-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"So how do you feel about that first one? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay, well hopefully we'll give you like some- some tools like you know that might be able to. Like some person you can go into the setting expectation and the role expectations. So, uh, one that I noticed- and that I was really happy is like you acknowledged the behavior- every time that it happened you know you went into discussions about it, things like that. Uh, so I thought that was really good cause the first thing you have to do is like acknowledge that there is a behavior- before we can actually do anything. So what I wanna talk about over the next couple of minutes is how we can provide, uh, behavioral feedback that like specific- and succinct, and so hopefully limit the amount of time you spent- talking about it versus actually doing what you wanna do. Um, so I'm gonna-- We're gonna talk about a couple of specific, um, instances in the simulation, and we'll talk about maybe ways that you could handle that- in the second one. Um, so this time I really want you to focus on is on specific redirections- to make the simulation a bit stronger. So thinking about the time that Ethan, uh, goes into like the dark bigger voice. Um, during it you said one rule we should raise our hands and even know how doing when speaking- even keeps going and you're saying we can talk about this during lunch, and it's kind of this really long, um, back and forth. So the next time that like a student is doing something or talking about a topic that's not what you want to be doing, I want you to provide specific redirection. So for example you could do ""Ethan, we're going to use our regular voice in the classroom""- and then you can- like you've, uh, specifically addressed that and so why do you want to use something like ""Ethan, we're gonna use our regular voices"" versus engaging him in this conversation. from what's happening in the classroom and you're not really providing that specific- what is it that you actually want to have happen. So if you keep going back to the- well let's go back to rule number one- that's more time, that's more you know energy wasting that way- versus if you just address- the specific misbehavior in very succinct way- like you can move on with it. Does that make sense? Okay. I would, yeah. And because you won't acknowledge his behavior and especially if you compared it with the first days of school- you wanna set these expectations- so it's like students are going to constantly- be pushing you. So if they, so it started like having that clear- firm thing you feel to begin with they know what these expectations are. And it can take you know just really you can do it very quickly so even just going, ""Ethan."" Even addressing this behavior and hopefully you can get back to the instruction. And so gain so like the larger conversation. That's what we're gonna try to avoid. Does that make sense? All right, so let's do a little role-playing. My name is Coleen, in case you forget, I'm gonna be a misbehaving student. And you can- help redirect my misbehavior, okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, so-- Yeah, that's it. So and addresses it like right away, just be like Coleen, please, stop drumming, or Coleen, hands off the desk- like that, it tells me exactly what you want to have happened. It's really quickly and you know as long as you say it in this calm tone, you're not like- you know, so just, you know, please stop drumming. You can move on and-and keep going, so- Does that make sense? Okay, do you have questions for me? Okay, all right, um, so at the end of our five minutes- so you're gonna go back in and do this thing. Okay? So just think about everything that is specific redirections that we talked about, okay. All right. "
transcript,17-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"How do you think that went? How are you feeling? Pretty good? Uh-huh. How do you think you did? Yeah, so I'm giving that a five. You know, one thing that I saw that I loved is that you kept your cool you know the whole time which is a huge accomplishment particularly for a middle school classroom so you should be quite proud of that. Why is it good to hold your cool during these kinds of behavioral interruptions? Okay, so what would happen if you didn't do that? Why is it good for you to keep your calm? Sure, what's likely to happen past that too? So if you lose your cool, there's that student but also-- Yeah and you kinda jeopardize the whole classroom and you might lose the whole classroom , you know, when you get aggressive with things. So that's one thing that I saw you doing well is you maintained your sense of calm you know in the face of adversity. So one thing I wanna focus on our conversation is how you can provide specific and-and succinct feedback to redirect behavior. 'Cause in each of the instances, you know, that I that I observed, you were trying to pull or connect whatever the-the distraction was into the lesson but you mentioned that-that came at the expense of you being able to actually move through the lessons. So I'm gonna offer just a couple suggestions on how you can redirect some of these behaviors real quick so you can maintain your flow. So I understand that you should've wanting to   your student out but at some time at some point of the day, you got it you gotta just move. So you know in the situation where Ethan was drumming for example, what's a specific way that you can identify his behavior and then offer him a redirection? What could you say? Yup. So if I'm Ethan and I'm drumming. What could you say? So how about, ""Ethan, stop drumming, eyes on me."" You know, but then what if he does this and then he looks at you. What could you do? How could you be specific in redirecting his behavior? What do you think? I'm still drumming. everyone in. So first of all when you name a behavior, and then you wanna offer an act-- an action step. Yeah, so it's like, 'cause why do students act out in the first place for the most part? What's a common reason they act out? That well, oh that's fair statement. But they usually just-- they just want attention and so by using their name, that kinda gives them that attention temporarily, but then you're just gonna hit him with a redirection. So if you're drumming, you know I might say, ""Ethan, hands on the table, eyes on me please."" So you've identified the behavior so he's gonna put his hands on the table and then you've given him a suggestion or an action step about what he can do. Okay? So what's w-what would a non-response look like? If I didn't use that redirection, what would a non-response look like from your end? So if you chose not to respond to the drumming, what would a non-response look like on your end? What would you do? No you just chose not to respond to the behavior. Yeah, and what's gonna happen if I'm Ethan? Am I likely to stop it? Probably not. So that's the importance of naming the behavior. So a non-response as you just mentioned, is you just don't even address it, you know, in the first place. Alright? So that's the-- so that's the two things that I wanna have us focused on during this next simulation is when you see a potential behavior, it-it's not aligning , you're naming the behavior and then you're giving them an action step. And it could be real quick you know. So let's say I whisper to Rose. Alright? My name is Mike. So let's just say . What's a specific and-and succinct way? All right. Even more succinct than that. So that's great, but be a little bit more succinct. Okay or you could-- yeah, or, ""Mike, just voices off, eyes on me."" Because I'm whispering, so, ""Voices off,"" and then ""Eyes on me,"" because I'm not listening to you. All right? How're you feeling? You're good. Yeah, you gotta be specific. Yeah, so you're being specific to the student and the behavior and then you gotta offer an action step. So I'm gonna-- I'm excited to see you incorporate those two suggestions into this next session. Okay? All right. "
transcript,18-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"So, how are you feeling about that one? The  - or the one at the beginning of the semester? But we do the excel so because you like have learned something,   something, that little bird powers. So, we'll give you a one attack settings set for them. How's that sound? Uh- I think you did a really nice job. I really appreciate like how every time there was a misbehavior, you were like right on it, even when I wasn't on your ear. You were like there, you gave really specific feedback, um, and it clearly redirected the students back to would you wanted them to be doing right. Who did you think like you felt-- Good. So it's working. Yeah. Um- so, like it was- it was really good to like- you should feel really good about yourself. So, we're just gonna like work on some things that will help even better. So- awesome. Okay, so one things that I noticed was just periodically- and it wasn't every time- you know, when I wasn't in- in your ear. Um, was it um, like some of your redirections weren't very succinct, so we're just gonna talk about how to make our redirections very succinct to get students back on task. Um, so I am, um, thinking about when Dave turns to Savannah and starts talking about the superhero. Um, so, you said, um, like, ""Hey Dave, eyes up here. You can go back to that conversation during the recess. Your'e excited, but eyes up here."" So, it kinda like drags on for a little bit. So let's kind of brain storm ways that you could get Dave back on task, maybe just a little bit faster using succinct redirections. I don't think he needs to give a reasoning, but I want you to be careful with what your directions are so if you're saying what is it that you want Dev to do/ I think in a   is listening, so you can have eyes up here but he can still be talking, and I noted that sound of really like into the semantics and stuff- That is very possible. Well, I'm looking at you but my mouth's still moving. So be very specific as to what is behavior you want students to have. Dev, I need your eyes up here and I need you to be quiet. Okay? And so something you- you know- old task. So it's very specific, ends very to the point. Where e-even like using non verbals and they can see you as well   Um, repeating it, being specific and succinct, you're not- well, why do you think you would want to be- And even though from there- right. Um- I yeah- I totally agree with you. So, thinking about- um- so, let's think about like a couple of different misbehavior so we can do a little bit of role playing. I'll be a student- student Yeah, that's good. You can even shorten it, ""Coleen, stop banging the table, please."", but I do like that you're using really calm tone. It's really important not to just become like worked up. Cool. Not like it would worked up in your redirections that you're still even kids   students will respond much better than like-- Yeah, I would especially you know everything about like this is the first day of school, like you were trying to get to know them and stuff but like trying to be as- as   with all students. So, Dev, Ethan, Savannah were not gonna talk like we're gonna need to be quiet right now, like so just go by in that specific- so specific, succinct. Does that make sense? Okay. Should we- good questions when we might get up there? Okay, um, so, we're gonna ask you to keep the thing in just for consistency sake, but I will not be saying anything. It- it's classroom like, it's always different. See you when you start all over again. Okay?"
transcript,26-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"Alright, so how do you think that went? Yeah, yeah. So how do you think that went? How do you feel? Okay, determined to what? Okay. And so what's a res- what's a potential response to that from you as a teacher? What do you wanna try to do at-at a broad level? Yeah, well try to redirect some of his behaviors so that you can continue with the lesson. So one thing that I saw from the outset that you maintained for the whole of it, is that you didn't lose your cool and so affect and how you managed through those redirections or those disruptions is essential. So why is it essential do you think to maintain an even and calm heel? Yeah and they're middle schoolers and so it's not a likely battle you're gonna win. No, no. B-But that-that's one really great thing is that you stayed calm, there were a couple of instances too where you identified the behavior, so you're-- you were scanning for it, and then actually addressed it. Um, but one of the suggestions I wanna talk about for this conversation is how we can be more specific with addressing the behavior and then being more succinct. So when I say succinct, as soon as you notice the behavior, you know addressing it as soon as you can so you can continue to get back to what you wanna do with the lesson. Okay? So what's um, how, you know, what ideas can we generate about addressing say you know, Ethan when he was making those noises from the very beginning. What could you say that addresses the behavior and that's quick? So is that specific? Sure, that's a great um- Okay, even-even more succinct  or you could just say, ""Ethan voice off. Ethan voice off"" or you can even do a nonverbal, ""Ethan"" you know like that really simple and that let's you keep the flow goin'. Okay so that's one idea. ""Ethan, voice off."" Okay? So what about when he started whistling? What could be a-a potential option there as a strategy? Mm-hmm. So there's two options you can really do here. One you can just do straight to the action step 'cause if the other we're listening or we're supposed to have our eyes open or we're supposed to put our hands on our lap is that really specific to the student who's being infractuous? No yeah, so using the student name piece also develops that connection because why would the student act out on the first place for the most part? What's a common reason? Yeah and so by you giving that name, what are you kind of giving the student? Yeah you're kind of giving him attention and so you're like, ""Ethan, dude, I see you. Alright? But Ethan voices off."" or ""Ethan, hands on the table"". It's real quick and while you can keep going for that flow. So what about when Dev was talking about the superheroes? Remember what your response was for that? I know you're in the moment, but it's easy for me 'cause I'm not setting notes. Yes, you-you were i-it was admirable because you were trying to use Dev's contribution but eventually you sort of got into that rabbit hole with Dev, and then you sort of lost you know two minutes of instructions when it came to that. Yeah and so one of them was you know, how was that? I'm hearing something about being a happy and positive person and then Dev just sort of continued and you sort of went down that rabbit hole. So what's it-- what's a way you could've addressed that specifically to redirect Dev to get him back on task? Okay, well how could you name the behavior? What is he actually doing? That's unrelated, yes. So, ""Dev, that's off task right now,"" or ""Dev, that's off topic, um, you know we're talking about rules and expectations so voices off please."" I mean something, so you're naming the behavior there, so that tells him like, okay like superhero contribution is not allowed. But it potentially can be later on. So instead of just kinda farming it off until we'll talk about that later. So you just name that behavior and just say you know, ""Voices off please,"" or you know something of that sort. Okay? What would a non-response look like though? If you didn't address that and Dev continued to share, what would a non-response look like from your end? Yeah, yeah and what's likely are gonna happen? He's gonna continue and then potentially it's gonna jeopardize your ability to ultimately do what? To do the lesson, yeah. So by the time you go you will be five minutes in and you haven't covered any expectations. So we're focused on being specific so naming that behavior and trying to catch it early so being succinct from as soon as you notice it, trying to, you know it's hard to say it later but saying where the noise is coming from and the distraction, naming the student, naming the behavior and then giving them some kind of an action step about how they can fix it.  Okay? I'm excited to see you try it. Alright, here we go. "
transcript,29-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"So how do you feel about how that first session went? Yeah. Ethan talking? That's okay, you still got him and that was when he was talking about the superhero? Yeah, yeah, kind of later on in the session. Um, yeah, you did a really nice job. Um, great job. You know, when I buzzed in you followed the instruction perfectly and then just like you said you kind of kept up with that so you are not only timely and specific but you were succinct so your directions were really brief and to the point and that's so important because it helps the class just continue rolling, right? Um, so yeah if you had kind of put in   with that then you may have been, um, spending more time on these redirections than unnecessary so awesome, awesome job with that. Um, so let's see. So, what I want you to focus on with this next one is-- this is tough because you I was gonna say remaining calm but you're very calm as it is. Um, the only thing I might say is, um, how could you- how could you kind of change your demeanor so it's even more, yes, um, makes the students even more acceptive to the redirection? I guess, what do you think you could do with that? Sure. Yeah, so what do you think the difference is when you said that you know if I hadn't buzzed in you would've asked it as a question. So what would've been? Why is it to state it as um, full statement as opposed to asking as a question? Yeah. Exactly. Right, right and you kind of wanna keep in mind that the purpose of this lesson is to establish the ground rules there, right? And so yeah, if you give them too much choice well and like you said, ""Can you please be quiet?"" They have to answer for that, right? Um, good. Okay, and so what would-- At least you kind of already gave a nonresponse, um, so let's see when, I'm trying to think, um, okay so when Dev was off topic and he was talking about the superhero and I know you said you had difficulty deciding if it was Dev or it was Ethan. Um, but you originally said, ""Okay, let's hold off on that part for now."" Um, Ethan just said he wants us to be safe. What's another expectation that we want for our classroom so let's hold off on that thought for now? What could you maybe do with that phrasing? How could you maybe change that? Yeah. You could just say, ""Please stop talking about superheroes right now."" Right. You can just be really direct with that, um, and just notice you can-- Feel free to say the word please, right? And then sometimes teachers get a little worried cause they don't wanna sound mean and so, um, I know my redirections to you were over that. I mean yours was, you know, just kind of really really haired down. Oh, that's okay, um, but okay. I think you're-- You feel ready? No, I'm not gonna. I'm gonna have you keep it in just for the sake of consistency- but you are on your own this time and I'm very confident that you're gonna be calm and succinct and you go it all the way out. All right. "
transcript,31-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"How do you feel? What do you think? Yeah. Like beautiful   tones? Okay. Yeah, well why do you think that queue works well? Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think thats the key when youre providing like behavioral redirections, and there are other you know like layers on this but like at the base level, like simple, very specific. It is exactly what you want to have happen. Um, so and there are different ways that you can do it. Yeah it was like kind of awkward, like the whistling one 'cause youre like, What is an example? but like he wasnt-- I know that he wasnt providing an example, like, he was trying to be obnoxious. And thats just because I know. Yeah. It was like really like poorly timed. Like it was a great time but it was poorly timed because he was not trying to  . And I know-- I just wrote- and I was like, No way detentions will work. Um, which you might not have in the-in the classroom so I understand that. I think you did a really nice job, um, and I think one of the things for behavioral, uh, redirections is being very specific. Its the same to being really calm, um, and I think you did just a really nice job of it. Um, so like I- this is gonna come across as like me not having much to say, but its just because you did a really nice job. Um, so we can just kind of like practice on different things, um, so that you feel that youre more confident going forward. 'Cause like you should feel really good- so I hope you do. Okay, from the first one? Yeah. Yeah but like-- So this is-so hopefully like you know my little bugs in ear- Its just a-its a suggestion. You know there are things that you can say, um, you know like another thing you can think about is just like the next time that Ethan is talking or Dev is talking or whoever is talking, you can use a lot of non verbals too. You know, if you feel comfortable with that. dont do like, Quiet Kylie, or things like that. But even just doing like that, you know, it still is very specific as to what you want and you know as specific as you can be succinct. And its also like pretty calm, like just being like, Be seated. You know, youre not drawing a lot of attention. It could be a lag, yeah. You can just find that appropriate balance in there. I think you did a nice job, um, so it might just be a little bit of a lag. I didnt feel like they went like too far- like youve never had to say things multiple times. Um, so it could just be a lag but you can feel like- and its hard to explain sometimes its that gut like, Okay this is like- maybe they didnt hear me or something- Um, so Im gonna say it again,"" but yeah. Um, so we can practice different ways, um, for you, if I were to be an off task student that you could then redirect me. Okay, so Ill become an off task student  Hey Tyler do you wanna go and hang out after school? Yeah. Yeah thats good. You can think about- yeah-- I think and like your tone is really good too. 'Cause you dont want it to come across- like the big thing is like being calm and not letting things like escalate. And you naturally have a really calm voice so that plays in your advantage. Um, but you can play that like to your- yeah, play it to your advantage. You dont necessarily wanna whisper it-- Um, especially in this scenario because they wont be able to hear you. Um, and there are, you know, some things like when youre in a classroom you can get like super close to them. Yeah something like that, we just cant play with them, um, but the big thing is just using a calm voice. So keep up the being as specific in this next one being as specific and succinct as you were in the first one and just using that calm voice. Im not gonna be in your ear. Im taking the training wheels off. Im going to ask you to keep it in though. Do you have any questions for me? Okay, cool. We can get going then. "
transcript,32-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,4,"And how are you feeling about that? The first go through. That's good. Would you think that there is a difference in your redirections? Mm-hmm. So I think, I mean, one thing that you're saying, you said that they were shorter, I think that's really important for behavioral mis- like re-directions is to be very succinct. I mean you did a really nice job. And you very consistently provide these very succinct but also very specific re-directions. So you're telling the students exactly what you want to have happened. Um, so you know, like normal voices, please. When Ethan started at the end for that and then when dad started to go down the superhero, we're going to stay on topic please, you know, it was voiced off because you were consistently using these very specific, very succinct re-directions. So in my mind, it's not then definitely. For you, like you made it easier for yourself because you did a really nice job. So like don't take that for yourself.  Like sometimes it is you. Um, so you didn't like really, really a nice job. Um, with these like any moment, there was one time that like, I thought I was pretty on top of the walkie-talkie already started giving a redirection, like you were bam right there. So that was, it was awesome. It was just, it was really nice good. So, um, you're making my job both harder and easier for you don't have that much to say, but that's awesome. Okay? So, um, we're just going to talk about things and this is not to say that like you were coming across as harsh or anything like that, but it's just, you're at this level now where we can talk about the-the tones and things like that. It's really important when you are providing, you know, succinct, specific re-directions like you did to maintain a nice calm voice and he did a really nice job throughout that. But we're just going to kind of explore what those could be. Um, so when a student is misbehaving, whether it's a side conversation or whether they're drumming, you want to not come across as harsh or like you're jumping on them and especially when you think about it, it's the first day you're setting these expectations. So using your tone can be really different. So I'm going to provide you with two examples and then we can kind of talk through like what they would need for the classroom. So if a student is drumming on the desk and you were to say I need you to stop drumming right now versus stop doing that, I need you to stop drumming right now. What do you hear different in those tones? Yes, It's still showing that like, I'm not trying to attack you and I understand these things, but we need to get back to the behavior. So I think, um, you know, because you are already providing these very succinct, specific redirection such as something to think about, like, you know, your tone, what does that mean? What are all of these different words like how can they come across? Does that make sense? Do you have any questions for me? Like. Okay. All right, cool. Um, so we are- Let's pretend that I am a off-task behavior, off task student behavior, exhibiting behaviors. Um, and you are gonna redirect me. So my name's called Yes, that's great. I mean, you're right on there and you can even think about using some nonverbal too. I know the secondary doesn't use like "
transcript,36-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"Um, so, how do you feel? What do you think? Like what? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, there's definitely is-- I-I know I agree with you about the lack of proximity, but even if you get proximity sometimes there's still gonna stop. Sometimes that doesn't work. This is the way to think like there are other ways to do this. Like this proximity is a great way to stop behavior, but it's not the only- way and there are still things that like we can practice that like role in a minute. hone in it. Okay. I think it has been Dev started talking about Mr. Fantastic and that went-- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I think one of the things I've liked that you're trying to like cut the students talking about Mr. Fantastic, talking about Darth Vader, but we also have to think like there are three other students who would like, ""Teacher we are gonna talk going on in here."" So, one thing-- I mean you have to at some point in time like end the misbehavior. So, for thinking about like even the whistling or the singing or things like that, that's not gonna hook back into- what you're talking about. So, when you're providing like redirections, just some behavioral redirections to students, you aren't thinking about providing things or really specific. So, it saying like, um-- So, for example, if Ethan is whistling, saying, ""Ethan, I need you to stop whistling,"" and like really meaning the behavior that you're gonna have happened- you're gonna enter to this back and forth. Like in there, there are a couple of times where you said like, ""Pay attention,"" and Ethan was drumming on the desk  and saying, ""I am paying attention,"" but I am still drumming. But, if you can provide the very specific, what is it that you want to have happened- that can help it. And, even so, we're talking about proximity. Like, sometimes I found like when I was in a classroom, especially when I was with like 7th graders, 8th graders, like younger kids- that like younger in arm-- rum--  of younger days. Like, when I was still approximately close them, I would still have to be like, ""Sure."" And, so, like at that one time will be like-- you know, it wouldn't be as for the class. In-- So, in this situation- I understand. Right. And, so, this is-- It is, but you still needed like practice like what are those things that you're gonna say- to get that behavior- to be-- Did you get to like your objective in this? So, we need to find ways that like we can end this behavior. And, like proximity i-is one thing, but there are still things that we can do- that's like not gonna super caught a-attention. And, a lot of that can come from like y-your voice and your-your tone that you use with them. Um, so, i-if anything we're talking like, ""Ethan w-was whistling."" If you can use like a calm voice like it's not gonna like calm out- you know, like, ""Ethan, can you stop whistling."" Like it's much different than like,  ""Ethan, stop whistling now."" Like there's a huge difference. So, it's not like trying to like-- You know. Yeah. Does that make sense? Okay. So, we're really going for like specificity. I think 'cause you don't even get that like, ""I'm paying attention,"" but you're still drumming- type of thing. Okay. Do you have questions for me? Okay Yeah. Um, you can go back in. Um, you'll have five minutes. It's like nothing ever-ever started. Or like the first one didn't happen. Okay. What do you mean work to that place? Like work to what place? Um, I mean I guess it's up to you. Um, as to, how you wanna do-- see if you can-- in my mind being specific like de-escalates things before they get too big. Um, so, that's why I would always like start off being specific- versus like letting things go for awhile because then like tensions then- can like appear. Like you'll just have to practice. Like just get used to just like your tone having- like a-a-a firm tone, but it looks like- it's not a harsh tone. All right that's all I ask. "
transcript,37-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"So, how do you feel about that? Good. Oh, yeah, that's-- It- yeah, it kinda just- feel like that it worked out I guess. Um, but yeah, that's an interesting observation. But I'm-I'm glad that you feel confident in there. Um, you did a really nice job. And so, the one thing that I saw you doing that was really stellar uh, it was like, you were specific in your redirections. You're also really timely. So, you didn't let a lot of time go by before you addressed an issue. And you also said exactly what you wanted your students to do. So, you probably heard me typing, uh, taking some notes. Um, so for instance, when Dev started talking about the superhero, you said, ""Uh, you know, it's important for us to listen silently when others are talking."" Which lets him know, ""Okay, I shouldn't be talking right now. I- I should be listening."" Um, and the word 'silently' is key there. Uh, another thing you said-- Uh, oh, when Ethan was drumming, you said, ""Can we keep our voices down."" Right again kind of making it very clear that he needed to be quiet while-while Savannah was talking. So, really awesome job with that, um, with being specific and with being, uh, timely. So, the next time you go in-- You're going to go in for another five minutes. Um, I noticed in this-in this one that, uh, sometimes your redirections were taking some time. And so, I want you to focus on being a little more succinct in your redirections. So, for instance, um, when Ethan was doing the impersonation you said, ""Hey Ethan, um, if you remember what we mentioned before about remaining silent when others are speaking."" And then he responded to you and he said, ""Okay, thank you."" ""But right now, we're gonna focus on, um, being silent in the classroom, listening to Jasmine."" So that was-- You- again, you were timely, you were specific with what you wanted but it took a longer amount of time there. Right? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And so, why-why do you think that's- why is it-why is it important to be succinct when you're giving redirections? Yeah, absolutely right? You know, attention spans are not always the greatest with-with younger guys, uh, younger kids I should say. Uh, and yeah, you're wasting-- Not wasting but kinda sucking up some classroom time that you could be using either for in academics or like   going over rules. So, just wanna kinda shrink it down. Um, so, let's say-let's say Ethan's doing impersonations again. What would you-what would you say to him? Yeah, excellent, excellent. Could you even shrink that down even more? Yeah. Right? ""Listen silently please."" That's perfect. Just shrinks it right on down there. Um, so what would-- Let's see. What if-what if Dev starts talking about the superhero again? Right? He was talking about Plastic Man. And your original response was, ""I think it's great that Plastic Man's your favorite superhero but it's important for us to listen silently when others are talking."" How can you shrink that down? Yeah, great, perfect, perfect. Okay, and so what would a non-example of being succinct be if Dev's talking about superheroes? Yeah, what's a non-example? Well, yeah. I mean that's-that's succinct, but then it kinda goes against everything else that we-- Um, so what would be like if you-if you were in your old shoes back here um, before we had this conversation about being succinct? What would be a non-example of-of being succinct? Let's say, if Savannah starts talking about going to the beach this weekend. Yeah, yeah, kind of again, going with that long statement. Okay, good. So, you know it's just gonna shrink it right on down. Um, so, right before the-before I push you back in there, same question before we have you go back in there, um, I just wanna do a little, uh, role play with it. So, I'm gonna pretend to be a student and I want you to redirect me in a timely and specific and succinct way. Ready? Okay. Yeah, good, right. And, could you shrink that even more? Yeah, perfect. Yeah, sorry I didn't give you my name  . Okay, all right, so you feel ready? Yeah, good. All right, awesome. I'm excited to see you be succinct again. Um, I'm gonna have you keep that on your ear just for the sake of consistency, but I'm not gonna buzz in this time. So, you're on your own. All right. Yes, yep, it's just like it-like the last one hadn't happened. "
transcript,38-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"I wanna start first with how you think that went. How you feel? Approximately. Mm-hmm. With Ethan in particular? Yeah. Well in terms of a positive note, I thought you kept your cool for most of the time, which was awesome. There was one instance that we'll talk about where there's like a little hint of I think a little frustration, but on the whole I think kept your cool. Why is it important to keep your cool? Fair, but what- but if you get angry, what specifically might- then the students- They might get angry or frustrated or even more defiant. So it's important, you know, as you just mentioned for you to be that rock, no matter what they're gonna throw at you in terms of directions. So, I wanna focus our conversation in just a few minutes, um, on specific and succinct redirections. So when you first notice the behavior, let's go back to Ethan's impersonations just 'cause that was one of the last ones. What's a specific and succinct redirection that you can give Ethan to redirect his behavior? What do you think? Okay. Is that succinct? No, 'cause there were a couple times where you sort of played back with Dev, with Plastic Man, you know, ""Well Dev, you know, tell me some ideas about what Plastic Man is."" And that's great for building rapport, but what expense occurs when you engage in that conversation with Dev? You in particular though as the instructor, what do you sort of not get to do? You don't get to teach. Yeah, so if you're- you know, if you're getting constantly go to, you know, one on one conversations with that, then you sort of lose the larger goal. So, how about a suggestion for, let's say, Ethan's doing his impersonations and it's like, ""Ethan, regular voice please."" you know. And then if he continues, what's another thing you could do to redirect his behavior? What do you ultimately want him to do? Okay, and so right now he's unable to do that because he's doing what? Yeah, he's off task and so just one quick thing could be, ""Ethan, voices of please."" you know? 'Cause obviously, he's not contributing to what you want him to do right now, and so you can just give him a quick specific redirection. ""Ethan, voices off."" you know, that tells him quiet and then you can call on him, you know, again when you want to initiate the conversation with him. So what do you think about that? So what would a non response look like in that situation from your end? Yeah, and what's a likely consequence basically on what we talked about? Yeah. 'Cause you have some, you know, some other questions like when that- when other colleagues shared they said, ""Oh, you know what? I raised my hand."" you know, looking for like, ""I'm trying to behave here, and I got, you know, this kid over here who's not doing it right."" All right, so let's- let's rehearse. Let's practice being specific and succinct. So let's say you see this, you don't know that I have my phone, but you see me doing this. What's a specific and a succinct redirection? Is that specific? No. Let's say my name is Mike. Let's try again. Okay. You can be more succinct on that. I'm with you on the politeness, but how would you be even more succinct? Perfect. Uh, more specific. There you go. Perfect. Yeah. So you're getting him like you're naming the behavior implicitly, but you're not paying attention, and then you're giving him a specific thing to do. As opposed to ""Eyes up."" you know, that doesn't matter, but ""Eyes on me, Mike."" you know, that kind of thing. Okay? So let's say I'm whispering to More succinct. More succinct. How about just, ""Mike, voices off. Eyes on me."" J Yeah. Just- I mean, real quick. So you're naming the action, you know, 'cause he's doing that and then you're giving him a specific physical redirection if he's, you know, faced the other way. I know the   terms, but in terms of like trying to get that redirection. Okay, and so let's do one final thing. Let's say that I just started to say something that's off task, you know, so, oh, you know call- you know, Ms. Casey I was at the fun zone yesterday and this was awesome and- Okay, name the behavior of that first. Uh, yeah or just say, you know, ""Mike, that's an off task."" or ""That comment doesn't apply here, you know, voices of please."" 'Cause rather than sort of put it back, you know, to the end of like, ""Oh, we'll talk about it later."" that kind of excuses it in the moment. Just be like, ""You know, voices off right now mike."" Just real simple, and you're gonna come- I mean you're gonna come back to him later that school day, but in terms of the simulation for that moment, do your best to be specific with naming the behavior, and then giving them a succinct you know redirection of what you want them to do. All right. I'm excited to see you try. You ready? Awesome. "
transcript,40-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"So, how are you feeling, after you- what'd you think? Yeah, yeah, it is a lot. So Olivia can give you some- some good tools to handle all of it. Um, so one thing that I noticed might be   is that, like, you noticed- like you started making like these faces with like- even with humming or like- you're clearly noticing these behaviors, like, really quickly, like you're having this reaction to it, and that's really important 'cause if you don't have that, like, awareness of it, like you can't actually do anything about it, yeah. Um, so one thing that I think we're gonna work on for next time, um, is to make sure that your redirections, um, are very specific. So the next time, so in this- this next simulation, um, you know, if Ethan starts singing or something like that, I want you to provide really specific, succinct redirections. So, for example, um, uh, when Ethan starts talking in the Darth Vader voice, you can just say, um- like specifically name the behavior, and then tell him what you want to have happen. So, ""Ethan,"" regular voice, and, so then provide that just, like, really specific- . Why do you think that might, um, be better than, like, trying to engage him with Darth Vader, and, like- or even saying, like, ""We'll talk about it at recess,"" something like that? Yeah. Yeah, I think the explicitness will help a lot with what the, with what behaviors are. So, name the behavior, how you want it- like what you want them to do about that behavior, um, and I think that will also allow you more time to try to get into, um, the norms and expectations that you want to be talking about, rather than Plastic Man or video games, or-- I don't even know. I mean, I watch his show, but, I don't know who he is. I will also say I'm not very into superheroes, but you know, just saying. So, we can practice, um, a couple times so you can try out, um, different things, um, you know, that are specific, succinct, and will hopefully help redirect   So, I will be an off task student, and then you can provide me with some feedback. Yeah? ""Ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da--"" I'm Colleen. It's okay. You could just call me Ethan or Deb or Savannah or whoever. I'll respond to that.  ""Ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba--"" So, I like that you were like noticing, but let's do, like, super specific. So you'll just be like, ""Colleen, I need you to stop talking right now."" And so like, 'cause then- and then you can ask ""Can you provide us with [inaudible ."" But, name the behavior, what you want to have happen, and then you can say ""Can you  "" or something like that. All right, so if I'm-- Yeah, yeah. So something like that. It's really- it's quick, it's to the point, it's specifically what you want to have happen, and then you can move on and focus on the norms and expectations that you wanna have happen. Okay? Do you wanna try one more time? Okay, all right, now I gotta give another-- Yes, yeah, no that's good. And, like, I think that will be, like, just getting it as specific and as quickly as possible will be very helpful, too. 'Cause you're using a calm voice, it doesn't sound like you're jumping after them or anything like that-- Yeah, no, no, no, I mean, 'cause, if you use that calm voice, or you say, ""Please be quiet,"" there's-there's nothing wrong with that. That's what you need to have happen. And you don't need to go into a long-winded explanation as to why, or anything like that. Okay? Do you have any questions for me? Okay, um, I think you have- maybe have like a little bit of time. Meditate for 20 seconds--  I'm gonna engage with mindfulness [inaudible . No--"
transcript,42-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"So how do you feel about that first simulator experience today? Good. Good. So you feel like you've made some improvements? Okay. Okay. Um, well, that's good that you improved from the very first time you went in and hopefully, the conversation we have right now will kind of help you continue to improve when you go in for the second time, okay? Um, so one thing that made me really excited was that you were very timely in your responses when students would start to get off task whether it was the drumming or whistling. Um, and you were very good at saying the individual's name and trying to kind of bring them back, um, to focus on the conversation that you're trying to have. And that's really great because then the student knows that you're acknowledging about that he or she is, um, exhibiting a behavior that isn't necessarily appropriate for class. Um, so but one thing that, uh, I want you to focus on for the next time you go in is being, um, specific. So, for example, in your last simulation, I noticed that you would say, um, Ethan's name. So you would say, ""Ethan, Ethan"", and you kind of tried to bring him back in or you'd say, ""Ethan"" then you would ask him a question, but it wouldn't specifically address the behavior that he was exhibiting. So the next time Ethan starts talking in a funny voice, um, as Darth Vader, I want you to say, um, ""Ethan, voice off."" So what-what's- how is that better than just kind of saying his name or asking him a different question? Right, right, exactly. So it's telling him it's not an appropriate time for him to be speaking. Um, so ""Ethan, voice off."" Just very simple like that. Um, so now we're gonna practice a little bit. Um, so I'm gonna be an off-task student and I want you to practice being specific in your redirection to me. Okay, ready? Alex, yes. Cool. And for that, you can even say, ""Alex, stop whistling or please stop whistling,"" if you feel like you need to be polite to them. Um, so I'll try it one more time. Ready? Good. Perfect. So you see how that was specific and I knew exactly what it was that you were trying to tell me, um, what you needed me to do. Okay. Well, I'm really excited to see you be specific in your redirections in this next, uh, simulation. Do you have any questions or anything? Okay. I'm not. So I'm not gonna buzz in this time. Um, just for the sake of consistency, I'm gonna have you wear it, um, but I will not be buzzing in. All right. You're ready? Awesome. You can have that over there."
transcript,44-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"So how do you think that that went? Yeah, yeah, that's kind like-- and you have to get used to that, right? Knowing that's not real student, but-- Um, well good. I-I thought you did a really-really outstanding job. Um, you were-you were timely, right? So you didn't let behaviors go on, and on, and on. You immediately paid attention to them when, um, something started to occur. Uh, you were succinct meaning you did not talk for a long time about what you wanted them to do and why you wanted them to do it and it what they could oh-- let, you know, what else they can do to replace their behavior. Um, so just some examples of that, so even at the end when Ethan was gonna try to do an air crash then and he said you know, ""Guess, who I am?"" You just said, ""Ethan, please intently me, thank you."", right? Quick to the point, that was wonderful. Um, another one, so when Dev started talking about the superhero said, ""Can you all listen silently? Dev, I need you to listen silently, please? Thank you"" So again even though he didn't respond immediately, you didn't let him continue to go on, and on, and on, and on. Um, you-you redirected him and he used his name so that he know exactly who you're talking to. Um, and again with the-the specific command of listen silently, so that was awesome. Um, and then again, even with the-the drumming, when Ethan kind of started with that. You turned your head to him immediately and you said, ""Please listen silently."" and he kind of continued and then you said, ""Ethan, can you please listen silently? Thank you."" So again you used his name, he knew exactly that you were talking to him and that you wanted him to stop making, um, excessive noise, so really awesome job with that. Um, is there anything that you want to work on? Okay, so moving around the room, yeah. Yeah. No, I think you did a great job especially with incorporating them into the, um, into the conversation. Um, I think you did a wonderful job with that. Um, one thing that I would say you can try the next time you go in is to be a little more specific with your redirection. So, let's say Ethan's drumming, you could say, ""Ethan, please stop drumming."" That way you're using his name and the exact behavior that you want him to do. Um, that way you wouldn't have to go back again that second time to really be more specific. Um, so let's say, um, let's say Savannah starts whistling, what could you say to her? Um. Yeah, right. Do something as-as simple as that. Um, so what would-what would like a not example be of that specific, being spe-being specific. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, which is still-- It's so specific but it's not meaning the exact behavior that you're referring to. Um, so that just something I kind of keep in mind when you go back in. Um, uh, let's see. So in, oh, well, um, I kind of mention this, but the-- kind of the importance of being specific again is just to make sure if they know exactly. Like there's no ambiguity, right? They know exactly what it is that you're talking about. Um, so let's say that-let's say Dev starts talking about superhero again, what could you say to him? Yeah, yeah, right? It so, it doesn't even matter what it is that he's talking about that's not relevant to the class conversation, so perfect. Okay, um, so we're going to do a little roleplay. I'm going to be a student, my name is Alex, so when I'm repeat that just   when you use my name. Um, and I-I want you to continue being timely and, um, succinct, and calm, and I really have to commend you on that. You were very calm in there. You were cheerful, you said, ""Please"", um, you said, ""Thank you"", so and that really really helps with the classroom climate, so keep that up. Um, but so I want you to be just a little bit more specific with your redirection. Are you ready? All right. So I went to beach this weekend and it was like totally awesome, it was so sunny out and it was just, it was just amazing. It was just-- I just loved being at the beach, I wish I was at the beach instead of in this classroom right now. Um, so what would you say if I was kind of-- if I was a student, um-- Yeah, yeah, if I just started to-- Yeah, right. Just hit the nail in the head, perfect. That's perfect because you-you said my name, so I knew exactly you're talking to me. You wanted me to stop talking about the beach. Um, use the word please which was again just a positive and very common thing and then were succinct and you moved on. You feel ready to go back in? Okay. I'm gonna have you wear that just for the sake of consistency. Um, but I'm actually not gonna buzz in this time so you're on your own, but I'm very confident that you're gonna do a great job."
transcript,45-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"How are you feeling about that? Alright, well we'll talk about them and some things you need to fill in to perfect for your next one. Um, so I think you like did a really nice job. And one thing that I saw you do it, pretty   was doing this um, specific feedback of saying, especially like doing this or that and just to make Ethan or Dev, you know and things like that. You've been very um, but your non-verbals were great. That was not a good verbal session. Can I just present it to you. I mean, it's very specific that-that the students knew what you wanted them to. And so, one thing that I want to um, try in your um, the next simulation is to make your redirections a little bit more succinct, um, because sometimes they just went on a little bit. So you have like the very specific piece, but then it just went on for a little bit. Um, so let's think about um, the time um, we can just do, I think the last one um, like where Ethan was starting to make noise again. Um, so Ethan starting to make noise was one way that you think you could res-respond to him making noise. Uh, that would be succinct. Yeah, yeah. I think so. I think and then move on. I think that's like the-the thing that was kind of getting you- wrapped up is that you would- Yeah, you would say, and I think you were trying to like bring it back to the rules and expectations a couple of times. But you can just keep them, keep going. You get back to what you were talking about because otherwise, it get's lost in the- in the redirections and stuff. So um, what's another way that you think you could be succinct because I loved this. I think this is a really good way to like get them to stop talking. Was [inaudible . Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. It's like which every way you feel more comfortable because it's really that specific, it's telling you- telling them in the action that you want them to do but it's also very like into the point. It's very succinct. Um, do it the way to assert, ""Ethan mouth closed,"" something like that. I would say that-- Yeah, I think you need to name the behavior that you want to have happened. Otherwise, you can just say his name over and over and over and over an over again. Um, but if you can name behavior and what you want to have happened. So, ""Mouth closed. Listen silently. Stop talking,"" something like that. And you know, doing a nice calm voice, you're not trying to be mean like calm down on the line. You could say, ""Please be quiet. Please close your mouths."" You know and it-it adds that nice layer of-of, ""I respect you and I want you to participate in this but, um right now, due to-- Which is show me the work. Um, so we have plenty of time and so we can do a little bit of role-playing. Um, so, I will be an off-task student, um, and and you can practice different ways to see which ones do you like to help redirect my off-task behavior. Okay? All right. That's good. I like that hands folded one too. That's good, especially with all the drummings.  Okay. Do you have any questions? Okay. All right. Um, we have plenty of time. If you want, think through anything or we can talk through anything. Um, we can just get into whatever you  . Yeah-yeah, absolutely, yeah. Oh sure.  Mm-hmm. What do you mean? That's-that's fine for-for this exercise here. That's fine, yeah. So I don't wanna go and against anything that your- management teacher is telling you but for our purposes here. Yeah, I don't know if anyone has anymore knowledge about that but-- Okay. All right. Yeah.  You can again. And we're gonna ask you to keep that in just for consistency sake- um, but I will not say anything during the excerpt."
transcript,46-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"So, how you feeling? How you think that went? Okay. How you feeling? Okay. Why don't you think it went well? Yeah, so a key thing with this simulation right now is some behavioral redirections- that needs to occur and so one thing I saw that you did really well, is that despite brief moments of frustration overall, you held your cool and why is it essential to hold your cool in a middle school classroom? Yeah, why? Right. Yes. Vocally, what does it prohibit you from doing if you lose your cool. Yeah, then you can't teach. Yeah, so if you lose your cool, you're more focused on the emotion of it as opposed to like your primary job there. So, on the whole, I thought you did a really nice job. There were a couple instances where I thought you were getting a little frustrated, which is certainly understandable. Um, so that's, that's one of the goals that I want to work on you know for this next simulation is that no matter how frustrating it can be is just to sort of maintain that clear face- of like you know that zen moment I want you to be but I want to-I want to focus the bulk of our conversation on giving succinct and specific redirection to students. So for example, so let's say Ethan is doing his drumming. What's a specific and a succinct way you can redirect his behavior? Mm-hmm. So, what, so he's drumming, you don't want him to drum, so what can you say to him? There you go. Okay, so that's one part of it. Why often do students act out in class? Sure, particularly middle schoolers. What's another reason? Yeah, we'll talk about that here in a minute, which is good. Or he could have at a base level he just want what? They just want attention. So one thing I'm going to encourage you to do is to name the student. So as opposed to sort of a generic, you know, ""We should have our listening ears on."" Just name the student because that gives them even that slight millisecond of like, ""Oh, my gosh, of all the students in the classroom, I was the one who was noticed, but it's very, very, you know it's like, ""Ethan, please stop drumming."" All right. So, if you want to you can choose that, real simple, real succinct and that gives him an action step about, ""Okay, please stop drumming- that's the behavior."" If you want to follow it up, you could also then just say, ""Hands on lap."" So if you want, you can name the student, you can name the behavior, ""Please stop drumming,"" and then you can give them an action step, you know, ""Hands on lap, please."" All right, and that's very specific. You've identified what they're doing that you're not really too happy with and then it gives them some kind of an easy action step to follow up on, all right? So let's say Ava starts to talk to Jasmine. What could be a succinct and a specific redirection to Ava? Is that succinct? Okay but you might go down a little rabbit hole. There we go. All right? And what's another- what's a final action step? Cause if she's talking to Jasmine she's probably turned this way? So then what's-what could you say to finish that redirection? Okay, or you just say, ""Eyes on me,"" you know, real simple. All right. So, let's say, let's do one more. So if you choose not to respond to the behaviors, what's a likely outcome? Yeah, it's gonna explode in your face. So like hitting these early and hitting them it's cause you gotta maintain your flow- and so that's why being specific and then offering that action step just lets you sort of like, you know, ""Dev, eyes up--"" or you know, ""Voices off, eyes on me,"" real quick and that let's you keep going. So one thing if you see me looking down like this, you don't know, I have my phone, my name is Mike. All right, what would you-- What could be a redirection? Okay. We don't if I'm on the phone yet. So what would you say? So table's not going to be a tech issue but you can do a hands on lap. Very good. So you've named-you named the behavior and then you've given them a nice redirection of what you'd want them to do. All right, sounds good? So we'll name the student, we'll name the behavior, and then just name the action. All right. All while having that wonderful- effect. All right. I'm excited- all right. I'll see you guys soon. "
transcript,49-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"So how do you feel about that- first one? It isn't so bad? Yeah. Okay. At the beginning of the semester? Yeah no, it went like--you did really well, you sh-don't   ""I'm gonna embarrass myself"" right? You clearly did not so- and that was really good. Um, so I've-like you're a really nice job like hopping on immediately and providing these like very specific cues to students. So what like, ""Dev, quiet please, thank you"" so it's like you're telling the students exactly what you want them to do. You're doing it like right when behavior starts, so I thought that was a really nice job. Um, so one thing um, like really I-I do wanna like commend you on that. So like you should feel really good on that like you use a really nice calm tone throughout, like you didn't-I didn't see you getting like frustrated or anything like that. Um, but we're gonna just talk about um, this-the last um, little instance where Ethan is impersonating Trump we're gonna just focus- on-on that one. Because that one you did some different things, we're gonna kind of like compare and contrast. Um, so um, when Ethan starts going off on um, on Trump, I want you to really think about making the re-directions very succinct. Um, so what-like any--you can think about at your previous ones that you did in that one. Um, so if Ethan starts impersonating someone what's some way that you can provide like specific, succinct re-directions for-for students? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah um, I think one of the things you know um, like E-like you ask them like, ""Do you have anything to add for the classroom?"", ""Is that something that's gonna be beneficial for our class?"". And there is somethings to like y-you know wanting to engage students and I totally understand that, but I think also you want that behavior still to stop. So um, you know like when he was impersonating Darth Vader like using regular voice- or something like that. So it's very specific- so we're not doing impersonations right now- like can you add a rule. So like, you're-you're clearly ending this behavior. And that's what you do--does that make sense? So how does that different than you know the other times--so if when you did this impersonation is there s-is there something that is gonna be beneficial for our class? We're gonna pause this conversation right now, we're gonna go back to it later. How is that different than like the other ones you did during that five minute? Mm-hmm. Yeah- so I-I think that like they don't have to be mutually exclusive. So if you're shutting it down, it doesn't mean that you can't make them be engaged. So you we're-we're stopping this behavior, ""Ethan we're using our regular voices, but I would love to a hear suggestion from you"". So you can make it, it's not like it has to be uh- you know um, so really think about like I'm-I want this behavior to stop. And then I will engage with you and aim questions about the- um, the content that we're-about what we're doing in class. Does that make sense? Okay, so you can see how that would be different than like- Yeah. Yeah 'cause then-you're s- You're spen--exactly and you're spending so much time on it than um- So- but you did a really nice job that-you know very calm and providing these like specific feedback throughout. So like this was just a one instance that was- that was different so thinking about how you can provide specific, succinct feedback across the board. So you-you know it's drumming or something like that. So we can do a little role-play- I'll be your math student,  beating on the table like  how would you-how would you re-direct me? Yeah, so it's really specific and like it's-it's to point- Okay, so think about that in the-in next--you did a really nice job about that and it doesn't come across as like harsh or anything like that. Like just using really nice calm tone- You can say, ""please"". Do you have any questions for me? Yeah, no um, No, so yeah just ending be very specific, very succinct and uh- uh- I'm gonna ask you to keep it in just for- 's sake. Um, but I will not be speaking. So jump. Yeah, like a lot of people I've-sometimes I forget to say that and I, ""I didn't hear you say anything"". Oh yeah. "
transcript,52-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,1,"All right. So Danielle, how are you feeling about your first experience with the simulation today? Good. Good. Um, that's also- yeah. It's a good, good experience to-to practice and hopefully the next time you go back in, you'll be even better. Um, so one thing that made me so excited that I saw you doing consistently was when one of the behaviors was happening, you were looking at the student. So you were really kind of, um, good at acknowledging that they were doing something that maybe wasn't the most appropriate for class. Um, and that's so important 'cause it shows the student that you're acknowledging them. Um, so- so the next time, I want you to focus on being timely. So to make the simulation even stronger. Um, so for example, in the-the last one I noticed that when, um, when Ethan was having behaviors, you were looking at him and you would try to engage him by asking him questions, but not until later on. So, um, the next time Ethan is drawing or whistling, um, I want you to be immediate, like, in your response to him. So it could be, ""Ethan, voice off"". Just right away like that. Um, so why do you think it would be better to, I guess, respond to the, um, behavior immediately rather than kinda letting it go on for a bit? So you could also do, um, a nonverbal cue. So if you're talking to Savannah, and, um, Ethan is, you know, kind of chitchatting her, doing whatever, you can do this to him, right, so you can show him. And what does this mean? Quiet, right. So you can do that that way it's not interrupting your conversation with Savannah. Um, however, you can also just say, ""Ethan, voice off, please"", and then move back to Savannah. So, again, just when it's happening, um, kind of  . Okay. Um, so let's practice this skill a little bit. So I'm gonna pretend to be an off-task student, and I want you to use the strategy that we just talked about to redirect me. Okay, you're ready? Good. Try doing it even faster this time. Ready? That's up to you. Um, it may also help to say their names, so, ""No whistling, Dev or--"" Since you're not doing else and else. Um, but just to make it quick and clear, right to the point, okay? Um, so I am excited to see you be timely in your-your redirections here. Um, do you have any questions or anything? Well, okay. Awesome. Are you ready to go back in? Cool. "
transcript,53-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"So, how do you feel about that first? Good? Great. Um, and, so, we're just gonna talk about, like, some specific things you can do to- I hope it will make you feel better in the second one. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.  It will be fun.  Um, so I think you did a really nice job of, um, writing, like, that, specific redirections for the students. Um, so, like, as-- Yeah. Like just stop drumming or stop talking, things like that is very- . Um, so, one thing that I want you to try to do in this next run through is, I want you to try to make your redirections more succinct- um, because sometimes they could go on- for awhile and you're losing that- that class time- there. Um, so, how do you think you could respond in a way that was a little bit more succinct? Yeah. So, let's think-- I think it would be easier to talk about, like, a specific example. So, Dev, talking about Plastic Man. So, what's something that you could do to redirect his behavior to on-task? Yeah. I think address him, like, 'cause that's, like, very specific- um, it's pretty short and it gets him back on- topic. Um. Okay. So, having it- trying to, um, uh, make it like ST words, that's impossible, I guess. Um, so, why do you think, like, the one you that you just provided would be better than what you did in the-- What's he going to into. He's going to That's not a role. Right. So, I think you're right that you can, you know, allow that, but, like, the minutes, like, ""This is clearly off topic"". You'll be like- you know- ""Deb, I need you to give me a rule""- or, you know, something in that- that's gonna be very succinct to a point- you know, very specific. Does that make sense? Um, so, let's- let's do a little role-playing. So, I'll be a-a-- an off-task student. Um, and then, you can provide a redirection- for me, when you think about what that thing and what to do with the kids. So many options. . Okay Did you notice that the weather is so nice out. I just wish that we- could-- Okay. and then, just making that specific succinct- to it. Um, and that can kind of a-apply to, like, all of the-the misbehaviors. Okay. Do you have any questions for me? Okay. Great. Um, I think we're-- Yeah. So, if you want to think about anything, well, we can also get back into it. Whatever you prefer. Okay. Yeah. Cool. Ready for round two, please."
transcript,55-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"so how do you feel about that? Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. Well, I- so we're gonna take a second to kind of talk about you were doing in the back end- um, but I wanna say that I think you did a fantastic job in there Um, you were timely in your redirections and specific, those were two- two really key things um, that uh, the fact that teachers do when they do redirections, so you didn't let the   go on without um, noticing them right the second the behavior was happening, you turned to that student and you would say their name and then you gave the exact behavior that you wanted them to either- either do or stop doing. So you're- really, really great job with that. Uh- heard me clicking away over here, I was taking notes so, um, just an example of that you know, uh, at the end when Ethan was doing his impersonation you said, you know please do not interrupt me um, listen silently to the rules, or if you a rule please raise your hand. So you were giving them exact behaviors for what to do, or what not to do for that matter. Uh, so that was really stellar. So going ahead um, the one thing that I want you to focus on in addition to being specific and timely is to be a little more succinct in- in your redirections and I know that that's a really tough thing to do um, hard to keep in mind when you're up there because you wanna make sure you give them all the information that they need. Um, so that's what I'd- I'd like to see you work on with that because that will kind of help you- help save time where you can now just move on with your material, right? Um, so let's say that uh, let's see, so in this- in the- in the simulator when Dev was doing his simu- he was talking about Plastic man- you said, ""Dev, you can also raise your hand""  while also Yeah. Yeah, well you can still be positive, right? So how would you make a little more succinct? Yeah, exactly. How could you even- because it seems like towards the end there you really didn't want him to be talking about this   you- you then said you know, perhaps not in the context of the   so how could you more directly get him to just talk about what you want him to talk about? Yeah, but what if she says, ""Plastic man has all these great-"" Sure, you could do that or you could even just say um, ""Dev please do not talk about Plastic man""- Right? you could go straight to the point. Yeah. Exactly, exactly, don't feel bad about doing that because you can do it and still be- have a positive um, acclimation about it. Um, so let's say that um- let's say Ethan starts drumming, which was a beat that we saw in there, um, what would- how could you succinctly redirect him? Thank you. Great. Perfect, perfect, perfect. Um, so what would a non-example be? let's say someone starts whistling, what would a non-example be? Yeah, right? and- and so why is that- whys is that not a good thing to do? Right. Yeah, exactly right because then it kinda opens it for- for repetition and um, kinda again takes up some of that time there, so.  Okay, so now we're gonna do one more thing, we're gonna do a little role play, I'm gonna be a student- um, and my name is Alex, just as a reminder in case you wanna use my name. Um, and I want you to continue being timely and specific like you were before but now add on that succinctness, you're ready? Okay. ""So I was at the beach this weekend and it was like really awesome-"" Perfect, right? can't tell you about the beach because that's not the rules. Excellent. Okay, great. You feel ready to go back in? Okay. So you're gonna keep that on for- just for the sake of consistency, I'm actually not buzz in this time. So you're on your own but you'll have Okay."
transcript,57-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"Uh, how do you feel about that? The first run through. Yeah, that there is like stuff doing it.  It's like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think- but we're over these five minutes. Um, we'll just talk about how we can like really get things like, clicking or whatever. So, I think you did a really nice job, and I know this may sound slightly ridiculous, but like addressing it every single time. So, it's to not let it like escalate. So every behavior that like, Ethan and Dev did, like you were like there like almost immediately like trying to get this to stop. Um, so one thing I think that we're gonna- that we are gonna talk about in this little five minutes is how to make it a little more succinct because you were addressing it, but then there was a lot of like, back and forth. So trying to get the students to stop the behavior like, without engaging this. Um, so let me, um- let me- okay. So let's take it out like when Ethan was drumming. Um, so you say, ""Ethan, Ethan, I love that you're wanting to sing, but we're gonna save that, um, for a break later."" Um, and then he says something moving on a break, we can assess your drumming skills and you kind of go back and forth like this for a little bit. And so one thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna make this more succinct. So what do you think is one way that you can make that redirection a little bit more succinct? Yeah. I think that would be like- 'cause then it's short. It's- it's your-- You have to like specifically name the behavior that you were to have happened. So, ""I want you to stop drumming, I want you to stop singing, I want you to stop impersonating people."" whatever it is. So you're naming this, and then you can like hope- So I think it would just be, ""Ethan, stop drumming."" and then if- then you can like kind of gauge from it. It's hard I know because it's like the first day of classes. You're literally setting the expectations right now, but I think of it just being like very succinct and using a nice like calm voice so it's not to like be  yeah, but being, ""Ethan, please stop drumming."" and start with that, and then see where you- where you need to go. So, uh, but think about it in another example. Um, we'll do something like if a student is having a side conversation, um, what's the specific succinct way you could redirect them? Yeah, yeah, and I think that's really good. Um, like, you know, if there's a specific student that's doing it or just saying like, ""Please stop talking."" You know, something like that. A lot of it comes from your tone and I know that it's really hard to like teach that or talk about that, um, but as long as it's not like- it's not coming across as like mean, but also not coming across as like exasperated. 'Cause if you come across like, ""Ugh, [inaudible "" You know, then it won't be as   effective. Um, does that make sense? So, let's think of like a non example of a redirection. So if a student's having a side conversation, what would a non example be? Yeah, yeah. 'Cause then you're engaging them and you're losing the whole-- That was a perfect non example. Um, so why do you think it's better to do like what we were just talking about, like the specific succinct versus the non example. Yeah. I think that's a really good correctional. So we have just a little bit, so we're gonna practice. I'm gonna be an off task student. My name is Coleen in case you forgot it, and you can redirect me. So, I'd be That's great. Right on there. Very specific right there. Okay, doing questions? Okay, cool. So I'm gonna ask you to put that thing in. I'm not going to talk, but it's just like for consistency, whatever. Um, so you won't hear me, you'll have five minutes, it's like we're back at the beginning. Starting completely over, okay? So remember we're doing specific, succinct, you know, calm, cool redirections. Yes, still setting rules. "
transcript,59-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"What do you think, how do you feel? Behavior and the thing? Yeah. Well, it's they're never practicing- Yeah. Yeah, yeah it's the thing like you have your-- like get better at as you're in a classroom, you know, even your student teaching like your first week, you're like tripling you're out of time that you spent previously. You know, so you can think like for a student teaching- you know, so it will come, and this is also like why we can do these things- so you can get more confident about it. So, I think you did a really nice job like you should feel pretty good about yourself. Like I know you're saying that you feel uncomfortable- but I was really excited because every time you were really like right on the misbehaviors and, uh, like they ended very quickly. Like things never like- to points where it's like I couldn't like really visibly tell you're getting frustrated or anything like that, so it was really nice. And so one thing that we're going to work on for the next five minutes, um, is I want you to try make your redirections a little bit more succinct. And so, just because it can take a lot of time when you're providing like multiple cues or something like- that even though behavior has already stopped that you are still going. So you want to just think about making it succinct that you can spend more time on like the task at hand. So this instance with more expectations, and so let's say that in this next evaluation that, Ethan, um, is drumming. Something like- Uh, how could you respond in a way that is, um, very succinct? Yeah, yeah- And- Yeah, you mean- Come on give me another one- Right, yeah. So you can even think about it this way and I absolutely understand the proximity thing is-is crucial, but even if you were like proximity close to him- you still verbally have to say something. Like sometimes yes, absolutely proximity- solves it, I agree with you there. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you still have to provide a vocal view. to students, so even if you're like mad of yourself walking over there- So that's-that's taking a lot of time. So you're still saying, "" Ethan, I can't hear Samantha talking because you are drumming."" please stop drumming. Versus being like, ""Ethan, please stop drumming."" And then you can get back on-on the task. And sometimes you did to like a nice job connecting things to, uh, the task at hand, but you still wanna provide those really specific succinct redirections. So what were non-examples of the succinct redirection will look like? Yeah, and you're right, like you're engaging them in this conversation about like, ""Why are you doing this?"" And talking about it for so long, that's not what we're looking for, why aren't you looking for that. It's like why do we not want to-- Yeah. I think you're right on about like there's so many others kids in the classroom that you need to be working with. And like, you know, you mark this it's like, ""Okay, this is happening."" You know it's something I'm gonna have to address or talk with them later, but right now I need to have this with either. Okay. Uh, so let's- let's practice, um, I will be in our test student and you can redirect my anger, okay? All right. ""Jenny, did you see that they posted new pictures?"" Yeah, so like being like on it, like right away, and I know it, I can feel like a drive and stuff but just being out there, ""Coleen, please stop talking."" and it's really just real quick and then you can get back into it. And as long as you're maintaining like this calm voice- Like that's cool versus being like, ""Coleen, stop talking now."" there's a big difference- Yes, it's the power of light, and that's not what you wanna do. Right, you wanna just be like, ""Coleen, please stop talking right now."" yeah, just real calm, you don't need to make a big thing about it. Okay, do you have any questions? Yeah, yeah. I mean, so we can talk a lot about that after like getting into the content- and we do have to establish those things, 'cause you don't know why he's doing it. If it's political if he understands it's- , so that's something that hopefully that you could address over time. On day one, you'd-- I think the thing is stopping the behavior. Like right now, the big thing right now is impersonation, and then like getting into the why's later is, um, important. But I-I do understand what you're saying 'cause I have concerns about that too, where we're thinking about this. But behavior has to stop, and then you can get into the why are you- Yeah, does that make sense? So it doesn't necessarily answer your question but kind of a tricky question. Which is all the teaching. So- Uh, okay, you're back in, you're gonna keep your piece in, but I'm not gonna say anything, and the, uh, you'll have five minutes for the very beginning. So nothing ever happened. Yeah just for inconsistencies sake. Yeah, yeah. "
transcript,6-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"So how do you feel about that? Really hard. What was so hard about it? Okay. Okay. Well, I totally understand that. Um, well, let's talk about some other stuff- that you could use instead of- sending him away. Um, but we-we'll use this time now, so when you go- back in you'll feel- a little better about it. Um, one thing that I noticed that you did really really well, um, is you were super timely with your redirections whenever a- began,- you would make eye contact or you would say, um, like   drumming away or- typing away back here. Um, you would say-- So let's say, when Ethan started his Darth Vader impression, uh, you said, ""Okay, Ethan, that's not what we're talking about right now. That's not appropriate. Um, does anyone else have an idea?"" And you kind of try to, you know, steer him away from that which is really- because that's not-- You're kind of nipping it in the bud, right? So having that timely redirection, um,- is- you're trying to prevent that behavior from persisting and- um, kind of distracting from others during class. So you did a really awesome job by being timely. Um, so the one thing that I think I want you to work on when you go back in- is being a little more specific in your redirections. Um, so let's see, so for instance, um-- Let's see. So even if we go back to that Darth Vader,- that one we were just talking about, um, you said, ""That's not what we're talking about right now. That's not appropriate."" Um, but the next time he- like if he starts doing an impression again, I want you to just say, ""Ethan, please, stop your mumble voice."" So do you see how that's specific? Yeah. So why would that be better than, um, maybe saying, ""That's not appropriate""? Yeah. Exactly, you're giving me the exact behavior that you want to see. Um, ""Please talk in your regular voice"", right? Again, like you said, stating it in a positive term. Um, but being specific. So when you say appropriate, what's-what's- maybe not so great about the word appropriate? Yeah. Absolutely, like it's totally subjective. It's like the word respect. Well, what respect is to you might be different from me, right? Awesome. Um, so let's see if I can find another example on here, um, let's see. So when Ethan started to making video game noises, kind of in the beginning. Um, you said-- So you were talking about what your goal was gonna be for today and you said, ""So what are some things, uh, what are some of the things that you think are important to build up a positive classroom community?"" Um, and you said, ""Ethan, we need your eyes and ears up here."" And he kind of continued. So again, you were really timely, right? You kind of caught that, the behavior was happening. He was making this silly noises, but what could you have done instead? Mm-hmm. But so he's making noises and you said, ""We need your eyes and your ears up here."" Right, exactly. ""Please be quiet."" Exactly, because my eyes and my ears can be on you, but- I can still be making silly- noises. Okay, awesome. Um, so what we're gonna do now is a little role play. Um, I want you to use the strategy that we just talked about, so being specific. Um, I'm gonna pretend to be an off-task student and I want you to be as timely as you were before and specific like we just discussed. Okay, are you ready?  Right, voice off. I know exactly what you're trying now. Okay, perfect. Um, I also like the tone of your voice, right. You weren't-- Um, you were very calm, you- weren't intimidating, you weren't, uh, abrasive in any- in any way. So that was perfect. Um, so I'm gonna do, um, do another behavior. Let's see if you can do it again. Um, so it's at the beach this weekend and it was like totally awesome and I just wish I was there- right now instead in the classroom. Um- Great. So that was perfect when you said, ""Voice off, eyes up here."" Be careful though, if you had stopped with, um, ""We're not talking about that right now."" Yeah because what's that. Right, should I just not talk about the beach- or does that mean I can talk about, um, playing video games later, right? So again,- that specific, but again, you did a really nice job with that follow up of, you know, ""Please be quiet right now."" That was perfect. And again, you're voice was great, your body- your body language is friendly and open to the kids so you won't be intimidating them- in anyway or-or kind of giving them a push back. So, good, all right. Well, I'm so excited to see you be specific when you go back in. Um, keep it up and do you have any questions? All right, cool. "
transcript,60-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,4,"How do you feel about that first one? Yeah. What do you think about well about it? Yeah. I think you did a really nice job. Like you were right on like with all the, um, behaviors, um, all of the misbehaviors. The misbehaviors, you know, you were right on there. You were very timely. Provided like really specific, succinct redirections to them. And, you know clearly asking-- I mean like you have the format that's written down. You know, ""Can we please have our voices off and listen respectfully to other-other people's opinion."" It's really like what you wanted the students to do. So, I like I really commend you for being specific in that. It can be hard to do. Um, so. Y-yeah. Like it was really, really strong, um, when you say, um, you know, ""Voices off. Hands to themselves"" and speaking their regular voices. Um, so, you did a really nice job with that. And, kind of thinking about what you're talking about with the reasons behind why you're telling them to do that. I think that's good, but you also don't want to spend a lot of time on that. Like when you're establishing norms and expectation, that's one thing. And, you can make those cross connections. But a lot of times when you're, um, like redirecting student behavior. Like you don't want us like spend a lot- of time on it because then it takes away from the, the task at hand. You'd rather have them engaging with what they're supposed to be doing. I mean like I've totally-- and with you like you, you want us-- like I can spend a little time in this. It's that kind of gray areas- to like how much is, is too much. Um, but you did a great job. And, so, one thing that we're gonna think about and this is not saying like, ""You did this."" It's just because you did such a nice job. Um, this is what we're gonna work on. Um, and just thinking about how like the, um, the intonation and tone of your voice, um, can really change what happens in the classroom. Um, and again, I just wanna make this like really clear. Like this is not like--  I'm not trying you did this at all because I think you have a very like calm demeanor in the classroom and I don't see you getting like-- at least I did not in that five minutes- see you get like really worked up or-- in fact it just doesn't seem to be you. I may be wrong. Um, so, one thing we'll think about when you're writing redirections is that there's a large example as to-- a large difference between saying, ""Can we please be quiet- versus, ""Can we please be quiet"". So, what do you think the difference is between those two ways of saying it? Yeah. Yeah. I think you're- you're so spot on with that. So, I think it's just one thing to think about, you know, like how you can also use your tone 'cause you can also use your tone for, for good- not like being a sarcastic, mean person. Um, so, it's always important to just kind of like keep that in mind and, you know, keep working with, with what your tone can do. Um, so, do you want to practice different tones or you feel good? Okay. So, in the next simulation, um, you're gonna go back to the beginning, first in high school like nothing ever happened. Um, and I want you to continue doing the- keeping your voice calm like what you did in the first one, but also, keep up with those very specific, succinct redirections. um, because it really was like spot on. Like I really don't have a lot of notes for you- or anything like that. And, so, um, you should like pat yourself on the back. "
transcript,61-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"Um, how are you feeling about that first run through? Mm-hmm. Right. [inaudible  So now we'll really talk about some things that will hopefully make you feel that you like did great-- Instead of like not horrible.  Um, so one thing that, uh, like I thought you did a really nice job on was like giving specific directions. Like, ""Stop talking"" or ""I'm going to need you to stop drumming"", you know things like that. Like it was specific. You named this thing you hear. Um, especially like when Ethan was like- , that's a particular instance. ""Stop drumming."" So I think one thing, uh, that we're going to work on is like making things a little bit more succinct, if you will. So, um, so what we are going to focus on is, like so- Ethan. We'll just take him and his- his drumming. Um, so next time that he does that I want you to do like- redirect with the fewest words possible. So, um, we can just say like, ""Ethan, stop drumming"". Um, so a lot of times you would be like ""Ethan"" let me look at like  my notes. Yeah, um, so you're like, you say, ""Ethan, Ethan, okay so what I was just going through, I was just speaking, I'm going to need you do all these things,"" before you ultimately say, ""Stop drumming."" So, what do you think is the advantage of doing like the- the succinctness? Yeah. Yeah. I think also like you can- you can then spend more time, like with what you want to be doing, you know. Like, so you're not rationalizing all of these thought processes. You can get back to the topic at hand. So, um, we have a little bit of time left. Um, so what we're gonna do is- we'll just practice. I'll be an annoying student, um, and you can, um- how you would then like use these re-directions. I'll just be like ""Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah"". Yes. So, you can do it, like  right away too. So the minute you hear something like humming or drumming or whatever. You can just go right off and there are tons of ways you know. ""Voices off"" Um, ""Stop talking"", things like that. So just saying it in a nice, calm manner, not getting frustrated. Or, even, just going- deaf. You know, it's not destructive, it's succinct, it's to the point. Okay? Do you have any questions? Okay. Right Right Yeah. A lot can come from your tone, too. You know, just being, ""Ethan, stop."" You know so it's just calm, it's quick. You're not yelling, you're just ""Ethan, stop talking."" And just keep kind of going on. So I think that's a lot of what you're talking about. It's like that classroom climate. Um, so I think using a calm tone can help with that. As well I think that's why I like stopping  things right away is really helpful. Okay? Alright, cool, so I think we're back in. So, yeah, keep that in. I'm not gonna, uh, say anything. Uh, but it should, it's just for consistency."
transcript,62-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"Perfect, thanks very much. All right, so we're going to say hello chat. Let's see how things went. So how do you think that first simulation went? Different? Okay, so what about it what's different? What do you feel? Mm-hmm, okay, so how-how are you feeling though? Besides a being different feeling? Yeah, okay, all right. So o-one thing that I saw is that for the most part, you maintained your cool. So despite, you know, some hints of frustration which we'll talk about later on, but the most part when those behavioral issues come up, you can choose to respond one of two ways, and one you can get a little frustrated and then increasingly frustrated. And on the other end, maintain the cool and, you know, essentially respond to that, um, 'cause there will sort of mirror your energy. So one thing that I really liked that I saw is that you kept a really big cool despite those pieces, so very good for that. Um, and why is it important to keep your cool? What do you think? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So one thing I wanna do to-to push you for this next session, uh, is, I noticed that you use some general phrases of everyone should have their voices off, or it certainly works, but I wanna try to push us to be more specific when you give some redirections to individual students. And I know in this similar environment sometimes when you hear an audio piece and then an action. Then, you-you know sort of a slight delay when you determine which student is potentially needing some redirection but encouraging you to be specific and then identify an action step that the student can do to correct or redirect the behavior. So the first part is naming that behavior and then the other part is then giving them an action step. Let's try to be a little more specific with those redirections. So, let's say, for example, that Ethan starts drumming, so what would, um, you know, how could you respond to that in a very specific way? Well, so let's say, Ethan's drumming, so I-I'll be Ethan and so There you go. Okay, so it might- that kind of low for that might be a little high but in terms of those three action steps but it could be, ""Ethan, pencils down, eyes on me please."" Just real- so really simple. So that you-you-you'd passed the identification stage about you know, ""Ethan, please stop drumming. Please put your pencils down, eyes on me,"" and you've offered him just a single action step that corrects the behavior. Yeah, so that-so that'd be a great way forward. ""Ethan,"" so what do you say again? Okay, all right. So let's try it in another scenario. So let's say, that I'm Savannah. Okay. How do we flip it? There you go. Yes, you're gonna name that behavior first so, ""Savannah, put your phone away please, eyes on me."" And then that sort of gives, you know, that process or introduce her in the classroom and so the more- the more scaffolding you can give the better. Great. Okay? So let's say that I'm Jasmine, ""Hey, so I was thinking about, you know, we could go over to a little bit to--"" Great, excellent. So you get to identify that behavior, redirect, then looks great. So what would a non-response look like? So we-we y-you gave us some great responses, what were the non-response look like? Yeah, ignoring or what's the other type of non-response that could potentially escalate the situation even more besides just ignoring it? What do you think? Mm-hmm, and what's the potential consequence or behavior from yourself that would increase the frustration? What's a likely response that we want to avoid? Yeah yeah, so the raising the voice piece, so as of, you know, if we can, in addition, we use the teacher's voice but the idea of that if you start to hear some kind of direction that you'll just talk a little bit louder to try it and but in terms of like elementary and middle school students, you know that social use will be a little bit lost on them. All right. So we get three rehearsals with that, and so why don't we try another one. So let's say, let's say that I'm Ava and if I'm just-- If I'm just doing this. Okay. So in terms of listening, it will be a little bit more specific with that 'cause they could've been listening with their head down but you interpreted that as potential disengagement so, ""Ava, eyes up,"" and then how could you be a little bit more specific on that listening thing? Yeah, there we go. So- so, ""Ava, eyes up, I'll appreciate, you know, you keep you know engage with us for this conversation,"" that kind of thing. So again the- you-you can either skip that implication if you just go straight to the action or name it and then do the action since we're working with little middle schools. Okay, let me try it out. How about that? "
transcript,64-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"Okay. What stressed you out? Uh-huh. Again. Right. Right. So in the next five minutes- we'll just go through like a couple of ways that you can- like hopefully keep the flow of the class going, but so like limiting student misbehavior. Uh, so one thing that was really good was that you always provided a redirection. You're always like right there with behavior like, okay, like let's engage in some- some sort of, uh, misbehavior. Um, so and like a couple of times-- actually most have they're very specific, like main behavior that you wanna have happened. Um, but a lot of time, it took us a while to kinda get there. So we're engaging this back and forth. So I think what we're gonna focus on for this next one is provide very succinct redirections- to students. So, um, let's- let me pull up-- I have taken notes. Um, I think were kinda like-- you mean like, one, Ethan is . Directly being like, ""Ethan, stop. Please, stop making this noises."" instead ""Be quiet."" And not be like, yeah, so let's think about, um, when Ethan turns into Darth Vader, okay. So this is a back and forth that you had. That's why it takes you to like, someone else was talking and, you know, like couldn't have that here without having- You're making this face, you're like, ""Okay, remember, speaking out of turn is not showing respect."" Um, and then you're going through all these like, ""What does respect look like? Can you explain what respect is?"" And it's kind of this back and forth between you and Ethan- about it and-and any redirection kind of like get's lost to them, like by the end of it. Like in event, almost like 30, maybe 40 seconds of this back and forth- um, before you say, ""I need you to stop talking now."" Right, so like you get to this very specific redirection, um, but it just took a while to get there. Respondent: Right. Um, so thinking about like very specific succinct redirections is like as when you hear this, we're bringing that to the-the forefront and saying like, ""Okay, Ethan, I need you to be talking in your regular voice right now."" And then you can be going back into like respect because- that you have to- behavior has to end first before you do that. So for example, um, let's say that a student is off task and they're talking to their neighbor- about something. You know, you could say, you know, ""Jasmine, I need you to stop talking right now."" Um, and a lot of it is being-- so it's like you're naming this behavior, being very succinct. But a lot of it also comes with like the tone of voice that you're using. If you don't want to come across as being like- You won't be- like, you know, especially this is the first day that you're-you're setting these expectations. Do you wanna be right there and then misbehaviors but then you also don't wanna be like cruel. Yeah. No. I'm just saying- if that's one thing that like some people want- will tend that like if they're being succinct. Like they can tend to where it's being like, ""Ethan, I need you to stop talking right now."" And that's very different to be like, ""Ethan, please stop talking."" You know, so it's just that these little things, like when you are being succinct- that you are. You just have to keep it like, the back of your mind. Sorry, I can't answer them, like no. Yeah, at a certain point, but it's like, you know, it-it's remembering that this is the-the first day of school and like, you know, you wanna be able to like maintain control of this. It's like what do you want, like presented of yourself to- into that- thing. Yeah. So you don't wanna-you don't wanna have that. And another thing that you can also do that is- I would say like even less the tarpal is doing non-verbals. So being like, ""Ethan-"" You know, it's very specific. It's-it's the same thing, you can get it back into it. Okay. Yes, then continue to do that. Yeah, you do that. Yeah. Um, so we can practice real quick. I'm an off task student, redirect me.  Okay. So I was like-- you stop like right here. So I was like, be really clear about this, yeah. 'Cause I-I wasn't even sure if you're like pointing at me or what. So if you're gonna do the non-verbal, be really clear. Okay? Questions? Okay, all right. You're back in to it. You just be- you're really calm. You're being succcinct to it. Restarted. You're back from the beginning, a very good place to start.  I'm glad you got it.  I'm glad you got it. "
transcript,65-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"Um, so how do you feel about that? [inaudible . Oh, why not? That's okay. Every day is different in teaching. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's one thing. I mean, there's a couple of ways to think about it, like yes, that is obviously- like you can't walk over, but it's also like if you have a desk with five students. When you're working in a small group, like you're as close to them like as possible, like you can't touch his desk and stuff, but like-- So you have to think of other ways to do, because proximity works a lot of times and like yes, I totally agree with you, but there's still like other ways that we can like help them. Um, so like you did a nice job and this is going to sound silly, but like addressing the behavior every time, like in a timely manner. Like it was-it happened, you started to address it. Which can sound ridiculous, but like I'm really glad that you're not just ignoring it. Like that-that's like step one which is a massive step to take, so--  So one thing that-- Um, one thing that I want to do for your next, um, simulation is to think about how to make your re-directions, um, specific. So when you're providing cues for them, I like your class   idea and stuff, but it's something like, you know you have to develop over time. So it's something that, you know, you kept still finding it and that's really good, but, um, you still want to think about providing like, in moment to moment specific, um, re-directions, especially if you're thinking about like, ""This is the first day of school, like I'm still working on my last class  ."" Um, so for example, um, when Ethan, um, was, um, drumming on the desk and Ethan- you said, ""Ethan, can I have your eyes on me, can we try to quiet down?"" He says, ""I'm trying, but it's not happening,"" you know, and then, ""Ethan, can we talk after class?"" ""Yeah, sure,"" but he still keeps going on. And so really providing specific re-directions. So, if Ethan is drumming on the desk, ""Ethan, I need you to stop drumming right now."" Why do you think providing specific re-directions would be helpful? Yeah. So think about it like what's the difference between saying, ""Ethan, can you stop drumming?"" or, ""Ethan, please stop drumming,"" versus, ""Ethan, can I have your eyes on me?"" Yeah, exactly, and like you will get the students ask like, ""Here's the line--"" You know, like-- Yeah, and so like when you can provide those very specific things, they know exactly what that means and then, you know, when you're establishing class   , you know, like in your   you have plenty of time, like you have a very clear definition of what this means, so yeah. Providing the specific re-directions- really helps. Does that make sense? So I'm gonna be an off-task student- and I want you to re-direct by me. Okay? Um, so my name is Colleen, if you forget, okay?  Yeah, so providing that like very specific, Colleen please   conversations. And you can think about it like, sometimes I feel like it's better to form it in like a declarative statement versus-- Versus a question. Like can we please, because Ivan used to be like, ""Nah, I'm good."" Yeah, and it's just like these little things and then it's like sometimes students won't even think about like- they're not like, ""Oh, she asked me, I'm gonna be snarky back,"" like-- But like, so sometimes I just think providing like those specific same things, and just be careful of the tone sometimes, like not in your-- You have to think about what that tone would mean. Let's see. So we'll try another one all-- Pa-para-para-para-para-para-para-para-para-- Well just- it- these just takes time and practice. So, ""Colleen, stop humming."" Okay? Oh okay, great. You feel good? Okay. "
transcript,69-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"Um, so how did you feel about that? Yeah. Like proximity and stuff, yeah. I mean proximity is one thing that we just can't do hear, but we can talk about how you could use other non verbals. Um, so I think you did a really nice job, like you always respond. Like every behavior, you responded to which is actually really good 'cause you don't wanna just take more of these things, um, 'cause you were providing feedback into it. So in this next simulation in the next five minutes, I want you to- we're gonna think about how to make, um, the re-directions a little bit more succinct. So, let's think about some instances first. I have like my double screens up here. Uh, look what they gave me. That's nice. Okay, so, um, let's think about some times that Ethan- let's go to the time that like, um, Ethan was drumming. Um, so in your simulation you said, ""Stop talking Ethan. Can you remind me what it means to be a respectful listener? That's something we can talk about outside of class."" Um, and like you kind of to have this back and forth for a little bit. So, um, what is one way you think that you can make that redirection a little bit more succinct? So, I mean think about this. So Ethan's sitting here drumming or whoever is drumming, how could you get them to stop that would be really succinct? So you're   'cause you want to get their attention, but then I think you need to like name the action that you want to have happen. So if someone's I think you have to name- you have to name the behavior that you wanna try and stop. So if you say, ""Not in here."" What does that mean? Does that mean like I physically am not in here, or what are you talking about? When you say, ""Ethan, stop drumming."" You have clearly named it and like if you say it in a really calm voice and I really don't get the impression that you are gonna I mean, just from knowing you. So, you- you just use that really nice calm voice. You can say, ""Please Ethan, please stop drumming."" So you've named the behavior. Why do you think it's better to use redirections that are much more succinct? Yeah. I mean can you imagine when you said to- to Dave, ""Eyes up here."" he said, ""Well my eyes are up here, but I'm still talking about Fantastic Man."" or whatever it was, right? So if you can name the behavior so it's very specific and it's very succinct. Does that make sense? Okay. Um, so what would a non example of a- of a redirection? Like something you don't wanna do. Yeah, and I think a lot of that can come across in like, in your tone and obviously the words that you choose, but I still think like you wanna provide- 'cause you don't want to spend the entire time trying to get them onto the task at hand, right? So you still want it to be like to the point. What is this behavior that you wanna have stopped? What is the behavior that you wanna see? So if you're thinking about like ways that you can still engage them, you know they can be, ""Dave, stop talking about superheroes."" Can you give me an example of a class rule. Okay. So really making it a specific succinct and we're talking about non verbals. I mean one thing that you can do is just, like, it's not seen as much like in high school and stuff and since this is middle school like it would still be pretty common to be like, ""Dave."" right? And that's, you know, put into the point. All right, we're gonna do some quick practicing. I'm gonna be a student and you're going to get me to stop, okay? All right. That's good. I'm glad you recognized that as singing too. Yeah, so just main behavior and using calm voice. You know, saying please, all those things, but making sure that's very specific and succinct. Okay. All right cool. You ready to try it again?"
transcript,7-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"All right. So how do you think that went? What do you mean? What's not well? True. All right, how are you feeling though? Okay, why so? Okay. Mm-hmm. Well, I think, first of all, frustrations, of course. You know, behavior management is a huge issue. Uh, but one thing I saw that you did really well that I like is that you did not lose your cool in the face of five minutes of behavioral regression. So why is it important to not lose your cool? Particularly in middle school classroom. Yeah, elementary and high a little different, but middle schoolers are particularly prone to eating as you mentioned, so if you don't respond to misbehavior, what's a likely response gonna happen from the students? Gets worse, yeah. So one student is gonna do it and then typically they'll   on one another, all right? So one thing that I wanna have us focus on for this next simulation is how to give specific and succinct redirections. All right, so for example, let's take a look at Ethan's drumming. What's a specific and succinct redirection you could give if Ethan starts drumming? Okay, so one thing I wanna- I wanna encourage you to do is name the behavior- by using their name as well and then name their action or redirection, okay? So why would it be important to use the name of the student? Okay, so also if you use the name of the student, so fair on that point. You're also being more specific as opposed to like we're-we're, ""We all have our listening ears on."" Is like- does that really- is that specific? No and-and it kinda creates a situation as you've mentioned where some of the students are like, ""I was listening."" So, also why would students act out in the classroom most often? No. Okay, also or they just simply want what? Yeah, they want attention and so by using their name briefly, what do you give them? Yeah, you give them that hit. So it could be, ""Ethan, stop drumming, hands down."" So you've- so you've named the action, you know, he's drumming and then you give him an action of hands down, all right? Or hands on your lap. You know, that kind of thing, okay? So let's see, what about- what about when Dev brings up something that's off topic? He does loves rockets, he loves superheroes, but how could you give a quick, specific and succinct redirection to keep Dev on task? Okay. Okay, so he's probably looking at you already- because he's sharing out this superhero, so one thing could be, ""Dev, that's not y'know, that's-that's not on task right now, voices off please."" You know, 'cause you're giving him the specific action of voice is off. You know, stop talking works but there's also sort of that effect piece- you know here as well- as opposed to like, ""Shut up"" you know? All right, so what would a non-response look like if you just let Dev continue to talk about things that were off task? Uh-huh, and what's likely to happen? Uh-huh, and so you've lost two of them. Savannah's three and then potentially  as well alright. So, let's practice. So let's say my name is Mike and you're our- you're the teacher and you see me looking down like this. Now, you don't know that I have a phone but what's a redirection you could give? You weren't specific. Perfect. Yeah, all right, so you gotta- so that name gives them that hit, and then eyes on me, please. Now what if they still continue- Okay, so that's one of the tech. Well, you can get your hands on lap. Yeah, so got, ""Mike, hand on your lap, please. You know, eyes on me."" And then you just keep on going. All right? So what about let's say Jasmine starts to whisper to Eva. So how would you- how would you engage that? Okay, was Eva talking? All right, so it was just a Jasmine thing. So Jasmine voices off, eyes on me please, okay? So just real simple. So you're naming the student, you're naming the behavior. So Ethan you know stop drumming or Dev that's an off-task contribution, you know, voices off, please. You can also do a non-verbal, you know. If you want to as well. All right, and so all of that though is encompassing, again that very nice affect as you had the first time because again if you lose your cool, what's likely to happen? Yeah, and then? Yeah. Yeah, the class exploded. All right, so it's important though for that non-response 'cause if you don't respond, it prohibits you from really doing what ultimately? Yeah, so- alright, let's   this to practice. Specific, succint. Name the student, name the behavior, name the redirection, okay?"
transcript,70-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"I know about that. Good. Yeah, so what made it way-way better? All right. Um. Yeah So, you're saying you've learned things over this semester. So classes have paid off. Well, there you go. That's good. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Right, and you couldn't. Yeah, yeah, I mean there's, there's one of those things, even when you're in the classroom too. It's one of those that you have to like figure out where's the line as to- like I actually need everyone to hear and I'm not like- you know calling this person out, because this is the first day, you know, we are setting these norms, so I thought you handled that- like really well with it. You know like, let's just broad speak like we're not going to use this type of- verbage and stuff and it's not like coming down on anyone. So I thought you did a really nice job. Um, I, so there are a couple of things that I'm-- like so in this, that you provide a really nice specific feedback- um, and so you're telling the students exactly what you wanted them to do- or just to stop doing, which is to stop doing. Um, which is really good. Um, so one thing that we're going to talk about in order to try to make the next one even stronger. It's how to make them a little bit more succinct. So I like the idea of like setting up the warning systems and the consequences, and things like that. But sometimes that was taking awhile. Um, and so you would eventually get to this like specific redirection, but I also wonder about forefronting that. So it's saying like, um, a-and just like, just making it a little bit more succinct. So, for example, um, when, um, if- Dev's talking about the superhero or something like that. So he's going off on that, I mean you kind of have a little bit of a back-and-forth with him about that. Can you see start out just by saying like that's warning number one, like you tried to get it back, but you still need to while, it might be warning number one, we still need to like-like succinctly name what that behavior is. So you're entering this back and forth, but I wonder if saying, ""Hey, Dev, no side conversations."" That's warning number one. And then you can move back, so you're naming this, and it's really, it's much more succinct than engaging in this back and forth, does that makes sense? It is what we do the simulator for. So in your reading and in your thoughts like why we think that we- it's in that order like maybe what this behavior is. Right. Yeah, I think, it's-it like takes, then you can spend more time on the task at hand versus on the redirection. And I know it's kind of jumbled here because you're setting the norms and expectations, but I think you're right that it like is, it's really clear. So, um, you're going to go back in. For your five minutes, so I really want you to focus on getting the succinct redirections. Still being really specific and what they are but maybe forefronting it. Just a little bit. Um, so in five minutes you're back to beginning like nothing ever happens. And it'll be great."
transcript,72-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,4,"So how do you feel about that? Yeah? Ethan's a lot? Yeah, I think you did a nice job like handling him though and you know, even Dev went off in the um, superhero-- Yes, so that's something we can talk about in these five minutes, for sure. Like I think if you can do that like that's why we also don't know we waste a lot of time- like in-indulging in that. Like it could relate, but it-- Okay. Well we got through the simulation so that- Oh, okay. Um, yeah so if you-- What was I saying. So yeah, so I- but I- you wanted to make sure like you're spending the most amount of time on the norm. So if you constantly find yourself being like, ""But how does that relate?"" you should be like, ""We're not talking about that right now."" We're talking about the rules. And so I think- and doing it with a calm manner um, I think will really help. So I that's what like- you did a really nice job like addressing all them like even when I wasn't the bug in your ear, like you address things like right away. And even in the last one, I know that like Ethan kept going and so- but you had said like, ""Quiet voices,"" you had like addressed it immediately and I thought it was great. You did very specific feedbacks, like you just knew exactly what you want. So when he did like- Ethan was drumming and you said, ""Quiet hands please,"" like that's very clear with like what you want. Um, and then it was very succinct, like it was so- it was right on there, so one thing-uh, no. We're gonna kinda talk to make your next simulation like even stronger 'cause I want like- you should feel really good about what you did. It's like tell about using like kind of a-a calm tone and like a-how your affect can play a part in it too, you know what I'm- you know what I'm saying? Uh, so let's think about, um, if Ethan or Dev or Sue, whoever is off topic, so let's say that they're humming or singing. Um, how could you respond in a way that is still specific and succinct like you did in this-this last simulation? Give me one that has like a calmer affect or tone. Yeah sure, phrasing or what like in your-your tenor of your pitch, things like that. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's huge, I think you're right on with that--I didn't mean to interrupt. Yeah that's great, so what would a non-response be, or like something that we wouldn't consider, um, like a calm-using a calm affect? Yeah, so give me an example. Yeah. I tell like it's almost hard for you  to like get in that. I think you're right adding like the, ""Please,"" in there, but I think a lot of it comes in through at the like the tenor-- You know what- you know what I mean- by saying like the tenor, like-- So I think- and you can also be assertive there too. Like there's- it's this really fine line of being like, ""Please be quiet,"" or saying ""Please be quiet."" You know, so you don't wanna like throw off the like quiet, tired, resignate- like resigned like, you know what I mean? Okay um, so why do you think it's good to like present that? Like calm manner, like what does that do for the classroom? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Great so we can do a whole- just do it real quick. Oh, that's five minutes. Okay. Were you- do you have any questions for me or? Okay, all right we're gonna ask you to keep the- your the thingie in your ear and- sorry was the thing- the technology still flipping back? Well we have a breakdown. Um, right, so you're good on your questions? All right, so I'm- you're not gonna hear me, I will not speak, but we just ask you to keep it in- for consistency's sake. Uh-- "
transcript,73-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"All right, so how do you think that went? You just hold on to that, we're gonna put it back in later on. Okay, so why not? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. More effective? Oh, classroom management issues? Okay. Yeah, I didn't get to that-- because you were- you were going from- from fire to fire with   and maintain attention. Yeah, but one- one thing I do wanna point out too is that on the whole, uh, one thing I think you did really well is that you maintained your cool. And so when those kinds of things come up it, you know, it tests not only your patience but it also then influences the rest of the classroom environment. So I think you did a really good job at the, you know, at the base level of identifying behaviors. You know, you've noticed a couple of them. And we'll talk about how we can do some suggestions- you know, for this next session, about how to address those, but first of all maintain a little bit of calm which is great in a situation like this because it can be trying-- and so what would potentially not naming the behaviors -what's a consequence of that? Of not trying to address these behaviors. Or just some kind of, yes, some kind of behavior that doesn't align with- what you're trying to do. Yeah, so why's it important to name those behaviors? Yeah.  Yeah and so, you know, with middle schoolers, for example, they might not have any idea, you know, that what they're doing is potentially, you know, hampering your ability to move forward so-- Sure, you could do that so-so we'll-- let's take an example. You know, so I noticed in the previous simulation that eventually say, for example, for Dev or for Ethan, for example, the way he was drumming, you know, I'm gonna ask you to go to the think chair. And so does that really give him any suggestions on-on what his specifically doing with that potential is gonna get him in the think chair. Maybe it doesn't. All right, so-so let's say Ethan, let's just say, you know. So I'll be Ethan and let's say Ethan is drumming. How could you respond in a way that's specific? How could you make sure? ""Ethan, stop drumming eyes on me."" I mean real- just real simple. So you've named the behavior. Ethan stop drumming- and then you've given him an action or a redirection, ""Eyes on me"". Okay? So you're with me so far? Yeah, okay. So how would you respond if I'm Jasmine, for example, and you see me looking down here. They aren't really sure yet, but you've done-- I'm a little bit off task. How would you respond? Okay, so you're a little specific there. So you were trying   we're trying to be a little bit more specific- with naming the behaviors. And so you might not, in this way, know it's a phone, but in general, she's off task. So how could you, without necessarily naming the behavior, give her action step? There you go, there, real simple. ""Jasmine, eyes on me."" Because obviously she's, you know, something else has her attention and so once you might figure it out, it might take you 30 seconds to realize that she's on her phone and by that point you've already wasted 30 seconds of classroom time trying to figure out what she's doing as opposed to, ""Jasmine, eyes on me."" Okay. So let's say- let's try a different example. Let's say, for example, that I am- that I'm deaf and I start talking about super heroes. So I'm just, you know, ""Superman's great, I love Superman, you know I think we should use superman for rules there- I'm trying to think about Superman's great, you know, I think- that's why we should really do this."" Okay. A little hesitant on the point . Yes, we're like, you know, ""Dev- Dev, I appreciate that comment, but that's off task right now and I'd like you to refocus on the conversation at hand to talk about expectations."" So when you're saying we'll talk about it later, that still doesn't really address it in the moment, if that makes sense. So you're saying, you know, ""Dev, that's off topic on what we're talking about. I would appreciate it if you voice off and we'll come back to that later on. Okay? So it's specific. Name those actions and then give them an action step. Sounds good? Okay. I'm excited to see you trying.   yeah."
transcript,74-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"Let's hang out. Um, so, how do you feel about that first run through? Why don't you feel good about it? Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think you did like a- a really nice job like recognizing the misbehaviors that like you're acknowledging it and you're like trying to fix it, which I know like, you sound ridiculous, but it's like that's the first step that you have to do.  You're like try and acknowledge and work on this. Um, so, what are we gonna do during on these, um, the five minutes- for our coaching session is that we're gonna work on my specific skills that you can- um, try to use that help the, the redirection. So, um, let's think about t-the next time that, um-- Let's think about Ethan, um drumming. We will just go with that. So, the next time that like, Ethan-- So, one area is that you kept engaging with them- and ask them questions and you would say their name. Um, but, one thing that you really think about to make t-this next round time even stronger is providing really specific feedback. So, when you hear Ethan's drumming, you say, ""Ethan, let's listen to Jasmine"". Um, and you're like, ""Does anyone else has something to say?"". You try to keep going. without ending the behavior. So, the next time that a student is misbehaving, so we have Ethan- on the desk, I want you to provide a really specific feedback and say, ""Ethan, you stop drumming"". So, you're meaning this behavior- that you want to have- happen. Um, or if Dev is talking to Savanah about Mr. Fantastic- or whoever it was. Dev, we're not talking about superheroes right now. We're talking about classroom expectations, but you have to specifically name the behavior- you want to stop otherwise, it's gonna be, you're like, ""Well, I'm listening, but I can listen when I'm  you know"". So, why do you think like what we just talked about providing that like very specific redirection will be better than saying like-- Yeah. And, even think about like if you do more than like-- if you're saying like, ""You know that you need to be quiet""- or something like that. That's a little bit more specific even then than like, ""Let's listen""- because you know, if you think about this is the first day, you haven't even got until what listening looked like. Like you haven't gotten- to that point yet. So, that's why you have to really name this behavior that you want to have- to have happened. Does that make sense? Yes. Yes. Something like that. So, but the first thing, and I know that you guys-- I'm pretty sure we talked about-- you talked about responses in the classroom? So, but-but like everyone skips over. The first that has to happen in that is ending this behavior. So, providing these specific things and then, you can start doing to engage them. So, Dev- So, I think- I think, I think that that's what it can give- like proving that specific thing because you will in middle school- and even in high school- and even as our other undergraduate courses- have students who are gonna push back and being like, ""Well, I'm listening. It doesn't mean I have to stop- or singing"". You know. So, you have to provide that specific- . 'Cause, you know-- Does that make sense? Okay. So, let's practice a little bit. I'll be an off- task student and you redirect. Right- in here. And, my name is Coleen. In case you forgot it. Hey, Jenny, do you want to go out  Good. Good. So-- And, you can-- So, you said my name twice. So, you can really like hop in- quickly. You know, like, um, ""Coleen, please stop whispering to- Jasmine"". So, you can be like right on it. Does that make sense? Um, and then, you're like,-- And, if you can keep it succinct, that's great. Um. but really the specificity is what we're gonna work on for this next round. Do you have any question for me? Okay. Right. So, you're gonna go back in. They're gonna start from the very beginning like nothing ever happened. And, if any misbehavior pop up, you're gonna be very timely. You're gonna be specific. And, you're gonna- do a great job. Okay. All right. Cool "
transcript,75-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"How do you feel about that first one? Right. Good, good. I'm happy to hear that. Uh, well let's use this time then to make you feel even better for the next time you go in. Um, so one thing that I think you a really stellar job with was you were very timely, ah, any time a-a misbehavior or behavior was occurring, you made sure to either look at that student or, um, you would explicitly say their name to kind of let them know that they needed to be altering their behavior in some way. So, that was really, really awesome. Uh, one thing that I want you to focus on for the next time you go in is being more specific with your redirections. Um, so for instance, with the last behavior that occurred with Ethan doing impersonations where he was trynna be Mickey Mouse there. Uh, you were really timely and you said, ""All right, Ethan, let's focus on the classroom norms. D you have any idea of a classroom norm you could focus on?"" So that kind of said to him like, ""Okay, you're doing something that I want you to change your behavior."" Um, but what's a way that you could be more specific in letting him know exactly what behavior you wanted to see? Okay. So be careful with the word ""be respectful."" Um, do you know why I'm saying be careful with that one? Yeah, absolutely. Right. Be respectful is a little general, so you wanna be really narrow. So if we're thinking about Ethan and his kind of being silly, and he's doing his Mickey Mouse impressions of, you know, ""Oh let's go to Epcot,"" or whatever. Or even if he's saying it on task or, ""you know, I think that we should raise our hands,"" but he's talking in that voice. How can you specifically get him to stop talking in that silly voice? Perfect. Right. That tells him, okay, no more impersonations. All right, very specific. Awesome. So what would a non-example of being specific look like? Yeah. Right. Exactly, and so that's why it would be better to do to be specific. Right? Okay. Cool. So what we're gonna do now is, I'm going to pretend to be an off task student and I want you to use your new strategy of being specific to redirect me. Okay. Ready? All right. Nice job. So what was different about that than what you did before? Yeah. Right, I know exactly what you were- what you were talking about. All right, let's try one more. Um, so we went to the beach this weekend and it was really awesome. The sun was out and- Good. Good. Right, you're gonna- so the beach isn't the lesson, so please stop talking about your trip to the beach. Right? Being very specific there. Awesome. Okay, do you have any questions or anything? Okay. Well, next I need to see you be more specific and keep up being timely. You're doing a great job with that. So you're gonna keep that in but I'm actually not gonna I'm not gonna buzz in this time. All right. Okay. Awesome. "
transcript,78-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"There's, like, a lot of clicking this. Um, so how are you feeling about that, personally? Great. Good. Yeah, so and, like, hopefully we can just make you feel even better- for the second time. So I thought that you did, like, a really nice job providing specific, um, re-directions, um, they were really succinct- and-- and quick timeliness. It didn't-- You didn't let things escalate- too far. Um, I really appreciated, uh, you know, when you gave like the specific, it's so important that, like, students know exactly what you want them to hear. So if, like, or they know exactly what you want them to hear. If that makes- any sense. Um, so I think-- Um, so for this next time- um, I want you to kind of focus on, um, like being very, like, succinct. So the next time, like, Ethan is drumming or- or humming, um, I think you can think about, like, using, like, the fewest words possible sometimes. So you would like-- you're saying, like, I'm gonna have to re-direct you and do X. You say that a couple of times- and so just say, ""Ethan, stop drumming,"" or something, you know, like- short. So, like, what would be the- the benefit of doing it that way? Yeah. Yeah. I think that's really good, and I think doing it right away, like when he was doing the impersonations, like-  kind of, like, that like, ""What's going on here?"" So, like, doing something like that, like- ""Ethan, stop the impersonations,""- and then, you know, moving on quickly and briefly. That's great. Yeah, umm, so we can- we-- I'm sure we have, like, plenty of time, um, so we can do just a couple practices. I can be a really annoying student- and you can practice, um, different ways that you could-- Yeah, so  Yeah, I agree. That's a great point that you make- and I would probably say- you know, and y-you can say it with a really nice calm- tone, um, and I don't think any time, like, I really, um, mentio- like, I really heard you, like, coming across as  just calmly- ""stop drumming"" because you might get that student, like,  Obviously, you don't want to open that door- and then to engage it. So-- Umm, yeah. Umm, I extend this to you. Try these specific succinct and calm- Umm, and I'm not gonna be the bug in the ear- this time, um, but I think you're still suppose to have it in. Yeah. Do you have any questions for me? Great. "
transcript,8-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"You can come over here and- Well, that's okay. Yes. Um, so, 'cause it's a room to grow- in a classroom. Um, so what do you think? What are your thoughts? Mm-hmm. Right. Yeah. I-I know exactly what you- mean, like where's this line? Um, so you have to think like in this five minutes, and like it's- Like things get- are like- more like escalating- a lot. And then even when you're substituting, like they're going to- So you almost wanna think about, like I'm-I'm cutting down now. Like I'm establishing these norms. And I'm not like a mean- I'm- these norms because really this expectations that I'm setting for you- and I- you're going to follow that. Done. Right? So I- the first thing before you can get to ask him to explain things, the behavior has to stop. Like that's the first thing that has to happen before you engage the students- in any type of conversation. So for example, um, let's say that, um, uh, okay-- so Dave's talking about superhero. And you say, ""Hey Dev, we're up here, we're up here."" And you get to explain these things, but you have to be specific about what you want. So, and then you kept saying that, ""Okay, I need you to reset."" What does that mean? What is that- so what- do they know that? So you need to be very specific as to what- you don't even have to be like- this is the first day of school. They don't know what you mean when you say, ""reset."" So I- you know, I have an ideas to like- you would want to be. But thinking about where these specific actions that you want to happen. So Dave is talking to Savannah or Ava or someone about a superhero. What's one way that you could specifically end that behavior? But first we have to do before you say that. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Why do yo think it is a good idea to provide specific, um, behavioral redirections? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think you're right on- and you know, and you're thinking about, like some situations you're going now. It's life at first stand essentially. It's like- so if you're being very clear to like, ""I need you to stop drumming."" Like- like they clearly- ""okay, I'm not doing that,"" you know. Um, so I think that's right on with that- So what would a non-example of a specific redirection look like? Something you would not want to say- to redirect students. Yeah. Yeah or even if you just trying to say that, ""pay attention""- you have to establish what that- looks like. So, uh- Okay. So we're gonna run through. I will be a misbehaving student. And I want you to redirect my- . So my name is Coleen. That's great. So you can even just go- ""Hey Coleen, I need you to stop drumming."" And then you can move on with the rest of your- your stuff. So be really specific with that. Okay. Do you have any questions for me? Okay, all right. So you're gonna go back in, um, and it's like that first session, never happened, very beginning. And we're gonna work on providing, um, specific impact. Or re-redirection to students. Um, I- your- I wanna ask you to keep this in, but you're- not gonna hear me what I'm saying. Okay."
transcript,81-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"So, how are you feeling about that first one? Little rough? Yeah. Um, so, I hope we're even gonna talk about like some things that will make it less rougher. In the second go around. Um so, one thing that like you did really well is kind of like you recognized every time that Ethan or Dave wasn't behaving. You know, you were right there picking acknowledging that this behavior is existing and trying to get it to stop. Um, so, through out this little couching session we're just gonna talk about ways that we can like, we can like specific into a pull they like happen. Um, so, one thing we were thinking about like behavioral re-directions that we really want them to be like specific and succinct and so a couple of times I was gonna, er, let me go back to one like when Ethan like starts drumming. You said like, ""Hey, Ethan, Ethan do you wanna even move here for a second or can you be respectful. you know, I wanna make sure that everyone else is paying attention. I know you like drums but it's constantly distracting things."" Um so, this time but that was-it took up a lot of time. So this time what I want you to focus on is providing, um, re directions that are very specific and succinct. So it's like naming an action and then having them stop it. So let's say again like Ethan is drumming, um, what are some examples of things that you can say that will maybe be very specific and succinct to get him to stop drumming. Yeah. I think- yeah I think there's our great example is just, ""Ethan stop drumming, Ethan hold your hands in your lap,"" or something like that. Um, so then what would like a non response of this be? You are giving a non-specific, non-succinct answer be? Yeah. Yeah. So why do you think that that first ones that you did like the stop drumming will be better? Yeah. Yeah. So, there I think that's like you are right on with that. So, think like if there's   about a behavior when Dave was taking about super heroes through fantastic men. So what is a specific succinct re-direction you'd provide when like he's talking about that? Yeah. I think like you wanna think about like using as few words as possible and like you can even use non-verbals like they can see you and stuff. So you come to like Dave. You know, cause if you enter into these negotiations, ""Oh, we can talk about that later,"" you are not still providing them with that like specific what is this actionable thing that I want them to do? Does that makes sense? Um, so what are some other like specific things you can say to Dave. So I want you to like practice this. Or if any student is talking about that. Yeah. I think one of the things if you say bring it back to our discussion It's not as specific as it could be. So if there were to be like if you really want their attention you want them to stop talking you have to acknowledge that they need to stop talking so it's saying voices off listen Um, so you can be like you know like, ""Dave, voices off please,"" and it's not gonna come out as harsh or anything. So let's think about it like if I was an off task student like how would you re-direct me . Yeah, so that you are just-it's specific you wanna spend as little time on it as possible and just using that nice calm voice so it doesn't come across as like, you know, you're rough. So just, just think about those as, ""Please stop drumming,"" or, ""voices off please."" So really being specific in what you want the students to do. Okay? Any questions? Okay, all right, cool. So you are back in it for another five minutes. "
transcript,83-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"So how do you feel about that one? Way harder than the other ones?  What made it hard? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So hopefully we can- 'cause you didnt look like you addressed behavior every time. So hopefully we can give you some tools during this five-minute coaching that will like, help like, narrow in the redirections so you dont have to spend as much time on it. Um, so I thought it was a nice job that you clearly addressed the misbehaviors every time and I know that can seem like a little thing but its not. Like, just recognizing that theyre going on and recognizing that you need to address them is a big part of it. So now were just gonna work on like, how to redirect and like, what are some things that you can-you can say. Um, so one thing that were gonna focus on is, um, how to make your redirections more specific. So, Im gonna, um, lets think about, um, what time-- Um, okay, so we can do, um, this last one, where Ethan was impersonating President Trump. So, youre asking   like, Do you guys have any ideas for these behaviors? Ethan, Ethan, whats our first behavioral expectation? Remember what I said at the beginning of class?"" Really quick, really quick. And so youre kinda, like, going back in this back and forth between Ethan and its taking a lot of time. So the next time that a student is having this misbehavior, instead of engaging that back and forth, I want you to really specifically name what you wanna have happen. And then you're able to move on. So for example, if someone is like, is banging on the desk. Takes their pencil and is banging on the desk. ""Please stop banging on the desk."" So you're giving this really, really, specific, uh, instructions for them. Why do you think that's better or maybe more effective, um, than engaging in this? Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully, you can move forward. So I think it's really important to be very specific in the actions that you wanna have happen. And-and you can do that verbally, you can also think about doing some non-verbals. Just being like,   you know, something like that. And why do you think we want- so we want these like very specific, succinct redirections? Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right on with that. And so we can do a little bit or role-playing. So I'm gonna be an off-task student and I want you to try to redirect my behavior. My name is Colleen, in case you forgot. So, right I'll start my, um, my misbehavior. So I like that you're addressing it. But when you're asking like, ""Would you mind?"" It's like, you know, I think Ethan said and then I'll ask him. It's like, ""No. Like yeah, I would mind right, I wanna keep going."" So I'm just-- There you go. Like, and that's like, it's to the point, you're saying exactly what you wanna have-have happen. So very specific. So if you keep engaging in these- and then like asking these questions, you're gonna spend more time and you're gonna get kind of lost in that. So being really-really specific with that. So if I were- I'm an off task student again, and I'm . Yeah. So that would be great. So it's just- and you can say it with a really nice calm tone. So you don't have to worry about like coming across mean or something like that. So just using a really calm, respectful tone. Please stop doing this behavior, and we're gonna keep moving on. Be as specific as you can. Okay? Do you have any questions for me? Okay. All right. Cool. So we're ready to get back in. Um, and yeah."
transcript,84-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"So how do you feel about that first run? What was rough? Yeah, I mean I think you did like a nice job, like you-- Don't-don't beat yourself up about it. So there's like really nice things that you did in that and so, for example, um, you know, like-- Sorry I'm just like looking through my notes. So, um, there are a lot of times that you provided these like really specific redirections to students like, they were plainly misbehaving, um, so eventually you would say like, ""Ethan, can you please stop talking. Can you please stop talking and be respectful."" And that   a good really turns. You do a really nice job providing the specific, um, redirections to students. So what I think we're gonna move to the next one, um, that would hopefully be helpful is to provide really succinct redirections to students. Um, so sometimes it would take you a while to get to that specific redirection, so for example on this one-- Um, Ethan is talking about the, um, ""Are you trying to be Darth Vader?"" and so he's talking about the Jedi code, and so you guys kinda enter into this back and forth and say that we don't necessarily live by the Jedi code but we can either work in the community that's quite   less like the other people's responses, things like that. Um, and then you get to do the, ""Ethan can you please be-could you please stop talking and be respectful."" And so that like succinct to the end and like if you've forefronted it-- Does that make sense? Like make the-the statement at a specific moment and going in-in that beginning. Um, so for example, um, let's say that, you know, a student is drumming on the desk. You wanna be as specific and as succinct as possible, so just say, ""I need you to stop drumming right now."" And then you can get- you can hopefully get right back into your-your conversations, but it's specifically meaning- what's happening? Drumming on the desk, there's that, and I'm being succinct about that. Why do you think that's a-a good way to like go with your redirections? Yes, so why would you not wanna engage in that? Like-- Yeah, yeah. I think that's such a good reason to do it, because then you're wasting so much time talking about that versus getting to the content at hand or the task at hand. Um, so what would a non-example of a succinct redirection would be? Yeah. Well, explain it to me, like, why is it a non-example and how we're finding  ? Yeah, or is it- you know if, um, someone starts talking about their volleyball match or something like that, and you are engaging with them like, ""Well what is it about your volleyball team? What do you guys do?"" And you're taking a long time to get there, like you really wanted to be succinct or even if you start explaining like the whys, like you just get to the-to the redirection. Okay? Um, so let's practice. I will be a, um, misbehaving student and you can redirect my behavior. My name's Coleen, if you forget it. That's good. So I like that you went like to stop talking because if-if you just say focus here, what is that, what is that, you know? So- and especially great thinking in our simulation on the first day so if you go to the-the specific behavior that you wanna have-have happened and that was to stop talking, or no side conversations, um, or listen silently, voices off. There's plenty of things that you can say that are really specific. Okay? Do you have any questions for me? Okay, alright, so, um, you're gonna go back in. Um, it's gonna be five minutes, um, like the first session never happened. So you're back at the-the very beginning. Okay? Cool. Let's do it. "
transcript,86-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"So, how you feel about that first one? Yeah. You mean you did a really nice job, you got a couple of the, uh, norms and expectations down. Uh, which was really great. Um, the one thing that we're gonna focus on in these five minutes is trying to get to spend more time on the expectations, instead of like having to spend a long time redirecting student misbehavior. Uh, so if you think that they are couple of times it was awesome, especially at the beginning, uh, where like Ethan was whistling and like you immediately said, ""Ethan, can you stop whistling. Thank you."" And you're able to move like right back into the   there was little time loss. It was awesome. Um, so then it's like you started to like progress through out. Um, there are couple of times where the redirection started to just take a really long time. Uh, So we think about, um, uh, like-- when Ethan starts drumming and he's been drumming for a while and you-- he's like "" I'm trying out for drum line."" And instead like addressing behavior, you start going, ""Who else has an expectation?"" And then you started engaging this back and forth with Ethan. So, one thing that I want you to think about in this next, um, simulation is trying to make your redirections really succinct. So- So, what-- all right go ahead, you do this amount of talk. Yeah. So, there are a couple of things and I understand what you're saying about like there's no consequences associated with the- the simulation but-but they don't have anything that they can lose. But I don't know if you always in a classroom or enter into that like bad behavior or misbehavior like- it's a punishment and stuff. Like you also want the people to end it without having to escalate it. And I agree with you there comes points for it's like okay this going to be, you know, like you're not gonna have to go to recess, but you really like, in my mind you don't want that have to be like your first segment you go to. If you wanna have other things you can help like end the behavior. Um, so one thing I want-- like thinking about when you're doing them instructions and the ones that you did, that were really strong or really specific and really succinct. Like you said, ""Ethan stop whistling."" Like that's so clear. Like that's very specific. Here's behavior that I wanna have end, and then I'm back to it. Versus, uh, like when he starts impersonating, um, Trump. You're saying, how is that relevant. Well then, you're engaging in this dialogue back and forth and you wanna have it be, if you can provide this really s-succinct. So for example- ""Ethan, we are not doing impersonations right now."" And then you can get back into it. Yeah. So, if you want to then engage the students in the- in the misbehavior or non misbehavior  in the-in onward expectations that's awesome, but you have to get behavior to stop first. So providing like succinct specific feedback is- or like redirection is really important. Why do you think that is? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we have, um, just got 30 seconds so we can practice. Uh, you can try to, um, redirect my misbehavior. Um, so my name is Coleen and, uh, I'll be, uh, misbehaving student. I'll  . There you go and I'm glad that you added beating on the table, cause if you just say please stop, it's like what are you, what are you asking me to stop? And I know that, that's can sound really tedious, but like naming it is so important. And you did it in a really nice job that was like, to the point. Okay. Uh, any questions? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so being really specific and really succinct is-- w-will be very beneficial. Okay? All right. Great. So you have another five minutes. Uh, and- it's back in the beginning like nothing ever happened. Okay. "
transcript,88-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"Um, so how are you feeling about that first round? Um, okay, so we're gonna go through like some specific things that you can, maybe you can get out, um, to feel better and fine in the next one. So I think in the um, that first time here that you can do a really nice job if you recognize each of the misbehaviors, like you address them in some way like I can clearly tell that you even- like like your physical   reactions like you can, yeah, there or there. Um, so for this-- the second simulation, I really want you to focus on providing um like specific redirections like you got to all really help make-make it stronger. Uh, so what I'm thinking is, um, is so when you're providing like specific redirections, it allows the students to like know exactly what it is that you want and it engages them less in the, um, in the misbehavior. So let's think for, um, a specific instance, um, like when Ethan started drumming, and then you're like, um, you said, ""Well wait let's think back to our first rule,"" and he goes, ""Well, I bet it was nothing about drumming,"" and he kept drumming. Um, what do you think is something that would be a little bit more specific that you could've said or done? Yeah and you would hope that he-he would and like I think the-the point is to like limit the engagement and the time that you are, um, on the misbehavior, if you will. So, um, like if you're really getting back to rules and spending a lot of-of time on it, so I think try to be like as distinct as possible also helps, like so you're like naming his behavior and like you're being able to redirect quickly. Does that make sense? So let's brainstorm on a couple of other ideas that we could maybe do . Yeah, I think you also-- like don't get caught like in referring back to the rules too, I think like in general terms, um, I think you know just Ethan-- asking for the behavior to stop like very specifically helps a lot too. So if there's something like, ""Ethan, stop drumming"" or ""Ethan, please keep your hands to yourself"" or something like that and that it's very specific naming behavior that you want to see and that you don't want them to be drumming or talking or humming or whatever out of turn. So I think, like I-I do like and I appreciate that you're trying to relate it to the rules, but you're spending so much time with this, um, redirections that like he's being very specific in what you wanna see. Hope it will help. Does that make sense? So let's think, um, uh so I'll be-- we can do a little bit of a role-play and I'll be a misbehaved student and think of what you could do to help redirect to my behavior. So I'm going . Yeah. So that's good, so like you're naming the behavior like you're telling me to stop singing instead of going to the longer  . So there's a lot of things you could-- can say like to me like to even just go like, ""Coleen."" Use something like that, it's very quick and it will allow you to get more in depth with the rules. So do you feel okay about that or like you sat- Um, okay, so why do you think like that would be better than, um, you know like asking about the rules or like trying to relate it back to those things? And you're actually right that we can hear a lot more from them before giving-- you know give more time for that instead of focusing on the misbehavior. Right, do you have any questions for me? Okay, great. Rose are we ready for the- Well great. "
transcript,89-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"All righty. So, first of all, how you think that went? And what's that mean? Yeah? how do you feeling? Yeah, just all right? Yeah? One thing I saw that I really liked is that despite opposition and redirection opportunities, you've maintained your cool. So, why is it absolutely essential to maintain your cool? What does that mean, things will escalate? Yeah, which is a likely thing to happen, particularly for a middle school classroom, you know they sort of feed off of that. But one thing that, again, that you did really well and is that maintained a very calm demeanor throughout and so I wanna encourage you to do that for this next simulation because that, as you just mentioned, can be really bad if they start to feed off of sort of your frustration, um, including, you know, sort of facial reactions in your affect in addition to the directions as well. Mm-hmm. Yeah, they do. Yeah. So, that was a good piece. One of the things I wanna focus this conversation on is giving specific and succinct redirections to students. So on the whole, it took a little bit of time, but eventually, you were pretty specific, especially that last one. The last one was awesome. Reed mentioned to Dave, oh, excuse me, to Ethan. He started talking in his impersonations that your comment was eyed up here and listen silently, please. I mean, that was great. Specific, succinct and just move right through it. All right? And so a little bit more like that for these future redirections. I think it's going to be awesome. Al right, so let's take an example. Let's say Ava is turning to look at Jasmine. What's a specific and a succinct redirection you could use if I'm talking over here to Jasmine right now? See, that's specific enough. You're speaking. Yeah, so Ava's talking over here to Jasmine. What could you say to Ava? Okay. So one thing I wanna encourage you to do is why would a student misbehave? What's a typical reason that a student sort of acts out in class? Yeah, and what's-what's another more common reason that's just sort of more base level, they simply want what? Yeah I just want like some attention. Particularly with sort of middle schoolers. One thing I wanna encourage you to do is to name the student before you give them the redirection because if you use sort of a general thing of like, we should have our listening ears on. Is that specific to the potential offender? No. Allright, so over here, just wanna add Ava's name before that. You know Ava, voices off and turn and face me, please. You know, so you've named them but you've given her action step of voices off and then turn and face me but you've also given her that little hint of you know, ""Oh my gosh like I was noticed. You know, out of all 20 people. She said my name. All right. So that's one example for Ava. Let's say that Savannah is looking down and you think she has her phone but you're not sure. So what could be a specific and a succinct redirection for Savannah? Okay, so she might have her hands, you know, on her phone, so what's the potential redirection for the hands as well as her eyes? Yes, well, there's a tech issue there too, but you just say, you know, ""Hands on your lap please,"" you know, just something like that. If you suspect that there's some kind of issue, you know. So, what would that text look like then? What would you say? If you thought I had my phone out and I was Savannah? Okay. So then- So then what would you say? Is that specific? How could you be getting even more specific than eyes up here or as up here? Yeah there we go . Yeah, so, just really simple. ""Savannah, eyes up here on me."" Okay. What would a nonresponsive look like from your angle if you chose not to address Savannah's behavior, what a non-response look like from your end? Yeah, well, from your end you would just not say a word and you went and attached it and then what's the likely consequence of that? Sounds good? So, name the student, and there's in that specific and a succinct redirection. Okay? I might jump in on the hear bug but I might not. All right, I'm excited to see you try. Let's do it."
transcript,93-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,4,"Come on I said   Um, so how are you feeling? How was the first one? Yeah, you lose by  of it that is per the day. Yeah, and I think you are doing a really nice job like you you've really timed it like even like a couple times I wanted to like redirect and like you were already starting your re-directions like you are like, right on it. I mean you did a lot of really nice like specific like succinct to your actions. I mean you started drumming, um, you know can you put your hands on your laps please like you were right in there. There are, um, a couple of times and this is like just making things even more specific and succinct because you did like such a good job it's like you should be accomplished with that. So we are just working on tools like make it even better. Um, when you are saying, ""Can you please come back"" try to think about ways to make that more specific. So you said that I can tell like that's definitely one of the things that you say. Um, but make sure that you are, you are like naming specifically what you wanna have happen so that if there are, they are like off task they are, they are drumming and they are humming and they are talking about classically and like you are naming what you wanna have happen as if you are just doing like a, a very generic, ""Can you please come back."" It's not, you like you need to name   Does that make sense? Um, but- but you did a really nice job and a lot of times you pair those things together and say it like, ""Can you please come back"" pretty make with your laps or something. Um, so sometimes you needed just skip straight at it to the change you are asking. Um, so, um, one thing I also wanna talk about is this is not like a you use this type of things, this is just like where I think you are. Like words are talking about like really you want such a type things? Um, and that's like the tone of your voice that you are using and again I don't want this to come across as like, ""You sounded harsh."" But what, you did such a good job. We can talk about how your tone and things like that can influence what the students take away from it too. Um, so one thing that can happen when, um, teachers are providing here are specifics succinct re-directions that can come across like really harsh. So there's a very big difference between, you know, ""Savanna I need you to put your pencils down right now."" Versus, ""Savanna put your pencils down right now."" And so there's one thing that I want you to be thinking as to like how tone influences what happens. Does that make sense? Um, so what do you think that tone like why is tone important? take or give out. Yeah. So in what ways tell it. Like keep talking, keep talking. Yeah, yeah. I think you are right on with that. That it's and it's just as creating like this   especially when you think that like this is the first day of school, it's creating this atmosphere like there are this clear expectations and I'm gonna be very specific about them but also know that I care about you. You know, like you   so much through. Like you're telling me. Um, I feel like it's really important to know that like all is just keep ahead in the back of your head. Um, so what we can do know is that I will be an off task student and and you can provide a redirection speed that will be a specific and succinct like you did in the first simulation and we can work on each of the specifics like that okay? My name is Carolina Yeah, that's great. So, and I can even tell like you know, you weren't harsh in the first one at all but I can tell you changed your tone like you were thinking about it during that. Um, so in event you're saying, you know, like, ""Caroline, please stop drumming."" You know, it's all in that. It's very specific, it's succinct, it's naming this behavior and it's really calm. Do you have any questions for me? Okay. Good, I'm glad. Um, if-so you are gonna go back in for five minutes and it's like the first one never happened so you are back at the beginning. Um, so that you reuse the expectations. Any questions or any first thing? Okay. Cool. "
transcript,96-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,"Okay I'm glad you made it. Um- so how do you feel about that? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Approximately I understand. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Wha-- alright, I totally understand what you're saying, we'll talk about-about that time behavior management strategies that you can use that um- when you go back in? Um- I wanna commend you so- you did a really great job of being timely and your early corrections. You know, you didn't-- every time a behavior began you would look at the student, you would say their name um- which really signifies to them that, you know, that they're getting something out of that   nothing you'd be doing or that to me that's possibly inappropriate, um- so really fantastic job with that you didn't just left them here and go, for on and on and on, um, because that can cause suck up all your losses. So, really wonderful job with that. Um, one thing that I want you to throw this on when you go back in is being a little more specific with your re-directions. So, um- for example, um, when Ethan was drumming,- you first started to ignore him and then you said, ""How about when we're travelling in groups?"" We're going to have to take time to listen in order to be prepared, let's talk to the persons next to us about listening, and then you said, ""Ethan, Ethan can I have your attention here for a second?"" And he says, ""Yeah, you got it for the  . So what would be a specific re-direction you could be a 10 that would be about drumming? Mm-hmm. So you could just say, ""Ethan, please stop drumming."" And then move right and then say, ""Okay, you know, pair up and talk to Jasmine about-- and you can move on with your lesson."" Right? So, it's right to the point, you tell him exactly what it is that what would you want to see or you don't wanna see. And then you can move right on with your lesson. Yeah, so, um, what about when Ethan was talking in his Darth Vader voice? What would you do? I know he's kinda comical. What would you do? What specific re-direction could you get from there? Yeah, totally. Right? Yeah. Ethan please use your normal voice. Right? Yeah, so when did you just said it?  Yeah, um, alright, let's do, let's see, so when-- Okay, that's agreed, yes. So what could you say there? Yeah. Right, just very simple you- or you could just say, ""Ethan, please stop impersonating Donald Trump."" Right? It's a little like that. Just, yeah, right to it, don't feel like you have to dance around. You wanna be specific 'cause then there's less ambiguity with the students. Yeah, exactly, but exactly what we've agreed what can you either do or- or stop doing. That make sense? Okay, cool. Alright, so, we're gonna do a little role-play, I'm gonna be a student and I want you to give me a specific re-direction. Are you ready? Um, so I was at the beach last weekend and it was like totally awesome. I just love the beach so much and I wish I was at the beach right now instead of being in this classroom. Yep, so now I know, okay? I'm not talking about the beach. Right? Okay. You feel all right if we go back in? You'll be fine. I'm excited to see you continue to be timely and be more specific this time- you'll do a great job. "
transcript,99-2C.txt,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,"So, how are you doing about that first simulation? Okay. So tell me why you feel reasonably well? Yeah, like, one thing I saw that I was really excited about was that, you know, for the most part as soon as the behavior started, bang, you know you were there. So it was-it was pretty timely and you were usually specific, so we'll talk later on with our conversation about how we could try to be a little bit more specific and a little bit more succinct. But for the most part, you were on it. You know, as soon as you were really able to notice it. Um, second thing. What I love is that you kept your calm.  So why is it important, first off, to be specific and timely with addressing the redirection? What do you think? Yeah-yeah. So it sets an environment, positive environment so that everybody can listen and just say great. Why is it important to remain calm when dealing with redirections? When you're in that typically with middle school? You'll never win with middle schoolers with that. So- So the importance of keeping your calm you know as you did, and the one of the things you have is you have a flow. So it was, it wasn't, I'm gonna stop abruptly, address this behavior and then I'm gonna stop and come back here. It was very-- for most of those interactions, it'd have great flow to it which was awesome. Um, so, well, one thing I did notice is that couple times there was a little bit of a delay with addressing the behavior. And then with being specific with it. So things like we, for example. Because, so one example, you know, that I saw was we need to have our voices off. So which is-- which is fine, but so let's say for example that you see that Jasmine, you know, she turns to talk to Ava. And what's the specific and a succinct way to address that behavior? Yeah. So instead of the collected ""we"", because that might not be as specific. It's, you know, ""Jasmine, voices off and eyes on me please."" You know, so just real simple, real succinct but you're naming the student. Why would this student, for example, try to act out in the first place? What's one of the typical reasons. Yeah. They're trying to seek attention and so by, you know, giving that name, that satisfies that small desire of like, ""Oh, you know, you know, Mrs. Johnson noticed me."" But then you're immediately, like, ""Lilian, eyes on me. Pencils down."" So it's real simple and you're just get to keep moving on and that doesn't disrupt that flow a little bit more. So what would a non-response look like? So Jasmine continues to talk to Ava. What's a non-response look like from your end? You ignore it. And so why is it important to address those behaviors in a succinct, and a specific and calm manner? And then ultimately what does that prevent you from doing? Yeah. So you can't make any progress if you spend so much time just putting out little fires. Excellent. Okay, so, let's do a model. So let's say I'm Jasmine and I'm gonna be an off-task student and so let's practice, you know, being specific, succinct and then maintaining that super cool attitude that you had in the first one. Okay. So how would you address me if you see me? I want my voice on. No. Okay. So how can we try that again. Yeah, so I'm an off-task student right now. And so how would you redirect my behavior? Okay. So potential way is to swap it at the beginning. What if you don't know that she has her phone. What if I'm just looking down? How could you ever ask that particular off-task behavior? So if you don't know what I'm doing but I'm not here, so how could you really do that succinctly? Or just real simple. Jasmine, eyes up and on me please. You know, just real simple. Because that's gonna take that redirection or what. So, sounds good? Are you excited to see it? Let's all be consistent, specific. And good luck. Yes, ma'am. So, I'll jump in if I think I need to. Um- "
transcript,2019_101_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"Hello. Okay, so how do you think at first run in the simulator went? Its challenging. So just so you know, it's totally okay to do that. Don't feel like you can't because, again, you're kind of being put into this with the context that its first day of class. And you would do that on the first day of class. But as you mentioned, with the classroom issues that arise its hard to get through what you need to get through when you do obviously focus on those other things but it's totally okay. And they're throwing a lot at you, I totally get it. So, but in the little bit of time we have, we can just talk about some things that will make you feel a little bit more prepared the next time you go in. So, first of all, I do want to mention that I was really excited to see that you were keying into the behavior the misbehavioras soon as it started, whether you're kind of like smiling or youre like just for looking at them right away. And that's really good because it lets us know that you already have the lens to kind of recognize that misbehavior as soon as it begins, so keep doing that. Another thing that you're constantly doing is when that misbehavior , you did make several attempts to in some way, redirect the . So, that's great as well. Um, what I think would be most for our brief conversation today would be focusing in on ways to make those directions as specific as possible to the behavior that you want to see stop. Okay. So, for instance, how about we do this, I'm going to kind of givego back to an example in your last , and then we can kind of talk about what happened and maybe how we can like revamp it to make it look a little better. So, at one point, about two minutes in, Ethan starts whispering, right? And you were talking about one of the norms is listening when someone is talking, so you were really trying to get at that that wasn't the thing to do by talking about what you would like to see happen. And you said, Ethan, the norm when I'm talking or when someone else is talking is to listen, and you talked about what it means to be a good listener. It means looking at me and that's my . Notice that he didn't really respond to that, right? And I will, I will comment that everything that you were saying was very positive, but just notice it wasn't having the impact that you wanted it to. So, one thing in terms of making it as specific as possible, so he was whispering, so be like, Ethan, please be quiet and stop. I know that kind of seems like a command, and youre on the first day. But you also have to realize that if you don't kind of saypoint out the exact behavior like you want to see stop, there may be different like miscommunications on, like, what he is and what you're expecting, okay? So, why might that be better? Like, Ethan, please stop talking or please stop whispering? Why might that be better than kind of the interactions that happened between you and Ethan in that scenario? I agree. Well so the other side of that, the flip side is just keep in mind that if you don't point out the direct behavior and you continue to have those long exchanges of, you know, back and forth, like the amount of class time youre thinking about and how that's the other students in the class. So, but I know where you're coming from, it's kind of hard because you're trying to establish rapport in this scenario in the first day. So, another thing I want to say, feel free again to insert please in there, so Ethan please stop talking. Try not to phrase it as a questioncan you please stop talking? Because that's not direct, right? And just trying to apply that to as many scenarios as possible."
transcript,2019_106_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"So tell me how you feel about your first simulation.  Uh-huh. All right. I understand. I think you did a really great job of being like, positive and calm the whole time, which is super, I mean, a huge base part of like keeping students engaged. If you react or negatively to misbehavior, that is like, oh, so wrong. So, thats a really great thing you should keep doing as you do the next and in your behavior redirections in general. And then, I want to spend the rest of the time talking about, Ethan, and sort of, how do you respond to that kind of thing. So, the biggest thing that I noticed in your responses is that you often like, were talking to Ethan when he was misbehaving. But you almost never said what you wanted Ethan to do or not do. So, you didnt actually give him the feedback about his behavior. Does that align with how you were seeing what happened? Yeah, you should direct. Well, you also didnt say you didnt explicitly asked him to stop it either. You said an expectation is that everyone is unless Ive called on them. And you saw head nodding so you asked, like, do you agree with me. And you tried to ask him to participate in the conversation like, asking him what do you think. But you didnt say to him like, Ethan I need you to stop humming or Ethan please be quiet directly. Does that make sense? Definitely, yeah. And so, I think this is not like a and I dont think you did a bad job. I think you were very about what youre trying to say. I think thats great. So, lets talk about in the remaining time like, how can you do those things in a positive way because you definitely dont want to embarrass kids but it is really important to be really clear with your with like, this is what I want and this is what I dont. Otherwise, kids get confused and if they do receive a consequence later on or other can start doing as they see he can do it. It can create chaos really quickly. So yes, dont embarrass them, yes be positive but we still we dont want to avoid giving them- sorry Im just looking at the time to see how much time I have left here. We dont want to avoid giving them that direction, and sometimes thats the most helpful thing in terms of managing behavior. So, how do how can I do that. Yeah. So let me, two tricks Im going to give you that I think have helped me with that. One is to like, you can stay away from the kind of dont do this and focus on what you want to introduce. So, the phone for example as Im going to put it on the table, I would you can say also like, just to put it away which is what he did at the end. So that kind of like, what is the thing that you want to happen thats always more positive than saying I dont want you to do this thing. You can also use nonverbal signals like if students making noise, oftentimes, just like that.. Its Yeah. Its very, very sophisticated technology. And that is both sort of like, less disruptive for you when youre talking. But its also more discreet, because you dont have to like, call out the students . Yeah. I mean, that was like, hey, Ethan one second, and then lets and then go back to Eva. And you want to make sure that you sort of like, continue what you were doing as quickly as possible. That also sort of makes it sends a signal to students like, this isnt a big Im calling everyones attention to. Its like, hey, Ethan.  So, thats where you can give the positive like, hey, Ethan and I would still do it still helps reinforce to other kids what the is. And, hey Ethan, were not talking right now. Hey, Ethan, please be were silently listening right now. And, you can also frame it in that like, we are sometimes its like  Yeah, he was just like, Im just giving you a reminder. And that kind of tone then. Hey, Im just giving you a reminder of what were doing right now. And its kind of like, Im just helping you out. Does that help? Oh Im sorry. Its been past the five minutes. So I didnt manage my conversation well. So, all right then. So head back over. So now, you have .."
transcript,2019_107_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"All right, how do you think that went? They were all frustrating? So Dev and Ethan were frustrating, how do you think you did? Sure. So first of all, one of the things that I saw was really awesome was when Ethan started tapping on the table, do you remember what you said? So, he started doing this, do you remember what you said?  Please stop the tapping so we can focus, thank you. And then what happened? He stopped like, right then. Right because what is that type of response? Right. So its a non-specific response? So one of the things that I want to focus on is to that beat-boxing, redirection, replicate Ethan, where it was very and it was very succinct. So like you named the behavior and then you told him what she wanted to do instead. With me so far? Alright. So lets practice a specific response from you. If I am Ethan and if I do this? Perfect. And okay, so that the addresses the behavior and then whats the last part of the equation? You got to redirect them? So you told me to do this and now whats the next step? What am I still doing? Correct. So how you can redirect my behavior? Is it everybody or is it just, Ethan? Just Ethan? So what we will do two steps, all right? So, say the first one again? And eyes up on me? Yeah. So youre going to identify the behavior that you want to stop doing but then you have to tell him what youd like him to do? Does that make sense? You with me so far? Okay. So lets say that I am singing, all right?  All right. Very specific response Okay, not lets because that lets off the hook.  And please listen to what your friends have to say. So again youre taking it off that sort of royal we, you know its like, friends we should all have our ears open. All right that doesnt identify the specific student that you want. Because its not specific, okay? So we would have non- response look like if I was whispering over here to Jasmine? Whats a non-specific response? Correct. Perfect. So now, how can you flip that into a specific ? Okay. You could also say, please stop whispering but again, name the student. So whoever it is, Ethan, Dev, Savannah? So, Savannah, please stop whispering and Fair but what you have to do, to turn this way. Yeah, even more specific though. Eyes up on me. You can just say that, just eyes up on me. And if you want to get really succinct you just say, Ethan voices off, eyes on me. Yeah, so you told him what to stop and then you give him a redirection on what you want him to do. You with me so far?  Okay. So lets practice one more time, all right? And lets say that Im doing an impersonation, all right? So lets say that Im trying to impersonate somebody. Yeah, so  Perfect. Okay, so then you named this specific behavior, stop talking and please use your normal voice. But you give him a specific redirection. Okay? All right, so lets keep going. What if I, what if I started to talk to Ava? And if I asked Ava, if she wanted to go to the dance this Friday after school? Hey, Ava do you think that you might going with whats a specific redirection that you can give me? What you think that maybe we could go the dance And up so please stop talking. Real it just getting real thing, youre just going to stop talking and then eyes up on me. So again if you told him to stop the and then youve given him the redirection on what you want him to do. Okay? So what are the three ingredients to our specific ? Whats the first thing? Whats the first thing and name the students? Yeah, name the student. Yeah because they have to know that youre the one Finding them in terms of this misbehavior. So once youve named the student then what do you do? Tell them what to stop doing? And then the third part of the equation is, tell them what they should be doing, okay? You excited?"
transcript,2019_108_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"Okay. So, how do you feel about the first go on the ? Okay. I want to say that I totally appreciate the fact that youre trying to relate it to like your experiences with your students and kind of comparing and contrasting some of the things that youre . So, lets just try to focus on a little bit of time that we have. Im getting you ready for the next time on the simulator with the avatars. I personally have some things that you are going to really love. I definitely appreciate that you are kind of pushing through and you were just continuing to have your discussion. You were doing a great job and like maintaining enthusiasm. And it didnt really seem like the classroom was like that challenging. So, you did a great job with it. Also, it was very evident every time that misbehavior was arising, you were it in a very timely way and making attempts to redirect . So, I think that one of the things that might be best for us to do in preparation for the next simulation would just be to really focus on making those redirections as specific as possible to the misbehavior that you want to see stop. So we can go back to an exact example. So, for like, about half way through, Ethan starts beatboxing, right? And youre talking about trying to establish classroom norms and expectations. And so, you are kind of like, Ethan, like, do you have anything else? Do you have anything like youd like to add? And he was like, yeah, we should talk about beat box. And youre like, well, maybe well think about that. And then he was like, kind of keeps going. But it was like, clear, you were trying to redirect him. But I think that one of the things that I would like for you to considered and you may just say like, Ethan please stop beat boxing. Okay! So, I know that like some people are like, oh thats Ava and sounds like where they come in a little harsh. But notice that by pointing out the specific behavior that you want to stop, there was no room for miscommunication, right? Its very clear that this behavior is not okay. And so, why might that be better for like a classroom environment than kind of like, subtle trying to get him to come back with us?  So thats why I didnt try it this time. So, let me kind of finish up with the last when you were saying, I really appreciate what you just said about how like, it shows the other students that youre respecting their input as well. And, just also think about youre not spending as much time having to continue to go back to her or able to like push forward what youre trying to do in the class. So, going back to what you said before last time when you try to point out the behavior and it didnt work. I dont know this for sure, but think about maybe, how you would have phrased it. So, is it possible that you would have said Ethan, can you please stop drumming? Because it is a question. Thats very different right!  So, if you didnt say it like a command or a direct thing, like, Ethan, please stop drumming or when you say can you. Like how it leaves it up to interpretation. He could be like, well I could, but Im not going to, ya know? In the little bit of time we have left, Im going to pretend to be an off-task student. I want you to just practice. No . Just a reminder, my name is Cassidy. Thats okay. Okay. So, you ready?  Okay. Good. So, thats it. Thats good. So, I really what you did here and thats great. Youre like, point out that was going, you made me think of the class, you made me refocus. Um, so, love that."
transcript,2019_10_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"All right. So, um, how are you feeling about your first go at the simulator? But, I know this is hard to do it like 7:30 at night. I totally understand. Its okay. So, hopefully in the brief amount of time that we have we can get you feeling even more prepared for the next go-around. First of all, I do want to compliment you on some things that you were doing really well. I do appreciate that you were able to maintain and, like, keep your eyes down. I know this is really hard.  And so I just want to say that I do appreciate that. And also, it was very evident that as soon as a misbehavior started to occur, you were keying in on it right away, so that tells us that you already have the lens for acknowledging misbehavior, like, as soon as its . And the other thing I noticed, there were quite a few timeswell most times you were working to, in some way, redirect that misbehavior. Some of those times were actually quitewere very specific to the behavior. So, for instance, the first go-around when Ethan was humming, there I think you said who whoever is humming, right now is not the time for that, and you need to stop. You pointed out humming was the misbehavior that needed to. And then there was another time, especially with the cell phones, and you are like I need you to put your phone away right now. So, I say that because those are great. I want you to continue to provide your specific for redirecting the misbehavior. So, um, but one of the things, so in terms of like continuing to work on the specificness, or specificity, sorry, but then also making sure that your redirections are succinct. So, as brief as possible. So, one of the things I want to look at... Yes. So, um, let's go to, um, the one with the phone. So, you got to the point where you gave a very specific redirection. But, before that you were like, Ethan, do you know what reset is? Do you need to go take reset? Yeah. And then you asked, like, who is the text from, right? So it took a very long time to get to that point. So, one of the things that I would encourage you to do, just like Ethan, please put the phone away, and then move on. And so how might that be better than all the attempts to redirect that were not successful?  Thats okay. Thats okay. And I can totally understand, I can totally appreciate that in your placements you are doing very different things based on the students that you have. Right this is, like, being very specific with this is the behavior that I want to stop and as brief as possible. So, the second thing is, if we like keep trying and in different ways. We are also taking away a lot of class time from the other students, right? And then like, that was when some of the students jumped in, like Jasmine, Eva saying they couldnt hear. So just, those were some things. I do want toI dont want to run out of timeI want to pick up on one of the things, real quick. You had mentioned please, and so you don't have to say please, so you don't have to say like, Evan, please put your phone away. You can say Evan, put your phone away. But what you dont want to do, you dont want to saysorry, not Evan, Ethan. You dont want to say Ethan, can you please put your phone away? Because if you ask a question that really leaves it open... To their interpretation. I wanted to practice but we're out of time. So, but I know you're going to do great. So, and succinct. Right. Yeah."
transcript,2019_113_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"Okay. Hi, so how do you feel about the first go in the simulator today? I understand, yes. The transferability of, like youre trying to relate it to topics of when youre in a real classroom.  And the way that your students will respond.  And I completely understand Well, I just want to push you a little bit on that because being in a real classroom, I was in the secondary math classroom.  Just know your kids will push you to the limit. All right but I want to point out some things that I noticed that you were doing and you were doing an amazing job at, so I just want to make sure you Youre well aware of them, so you continue to do them. Before that I just want to say, great job of maintaining enthusiasm, by the way because theyre throwing a lot at you and you handled it really well. So, the first thing, it was very clear that every time when students were in a misbehavior, youre picking up on it like immediately, which is really good because we need to see that you have lens already to those misbehaviors. And then second off, every time you were acknowledging those behaviors, you are making attempts to redirect, sometimes those redirections were very . So, at one point, you were like, Ethan, could you please stop humming? It was very specific, like that was the first one to what you wanted to see happen. And so thats what we want to see. Im going to just kind of give a little caveat. The one thing about that, that specific example, Im going to push you not to say, could you please or can you please? Just Ethan, please stop.  Yeah, because if you put it as a question, you kind of leave it a little open. Right? Okay, so youre doing really good. Like I said, youve given some specific directions, I want to continue to push you to do that. But I also think that in the little bit of time that we have, it would also be wise of us to focus on making those redirections as as possible. So sometimes youre spending a lot of time having this like, back and forth exchange. So like, when Ethan was whispering and youre like, Ethan, I dont want us to talk about that right now, I want us to talk about rules. And please stop whispering, eyes on me while were talking. So you did say, please stop whispering, which was great. But then you also like, so as that exchanged happened in the beginning, right? And then there was like, you almost felt like you had to give him an for why he needed to stop? Okay. You dont have to do that. You dont have to do that. So we want to try to make these interactions as succinct as , as brief as possible. And as specific okay, go ahead, so tell me that.  Exactly. Yes. And youre not able to solicit answers from the other students. And these things do translate into like a real class, right? Youre not going to want to spend so long, like just kind of going back and forth, grappling with one student and youre like, what in the world is going on right now? Right? Okay, so one of the things, were going to just do a really quick kind of practice with this, okay? So, Im going to pretend to be off task student. Names pretty easy because we got and then I want you to try to draw me back in, okay? Are you ready? Savannah, did I tell you  Okay, good, I like that. Um, so, you dont have to like, pause. I appreciate the fact that you were like, pausing to make sure I kind of looked at you. But you could, you know, you dont always have to do that. Cassidy, please stop talking, eyes on me, or something like that. The other thing I would say is also realizing in order making it succinct, the avatars can pick up on non-verbal gestures. So you could like it, I was just talking and I was kind of like, you know, kind of rolling around, you could be like, Cassidy And that works too. So, thats some of a way to be like really succinct in your responses. Obviously, you wouldnt want to do . But everything and it doesnt work for because sometimes like Ethan is drumming and Um, do you have any questions or anything? Like, that kind of threw you for a loop or... . Okay. It was a little beeping, I know its kind of hard to hear when youre engaging. Yeah. Yeah, its okay. Youre fine. Its hard to hear also. Thats okay. Okay, so were out of time. Rose is giving me the look. So, just remember I can do"
transcript,2019_114_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"How do you feel about, are you feeling about that first go? Okay. Thats all right, thats all right. So feeling, like it was a little rough, right? Thats okay. Thats totally all right. Its meant to kind of push you, right? Out of your comfort zone. So, hopefully in the little bit of time that we have together, I can get you feeling even more prepared for the next time. And hopefully you guys can get through a little bit more conversations about expectation in the class. So first off, I just want to say that I appreciate the way you just like kept at it, you kept trying. I know its hard kind of grinding through and trying to figure out what to do, right? But thank you for remaining optimistic and trying to do that. Second off, I want to know that I appreciate the fact and I acknowledge the fact that every time a misbehavior was beginning you immediately acknowledged it. And thats really important, important because that lets us know that you already have the lense to kind of recognize the misbehavior as soon as it starts. So, I want to go off of that. The other thing I want to point out, not only did you recognize the misbehavior but you were making attempts to redirect. So I think moving forward in order to focus on making the next simulation a bit stronger, were going to look at those ways that you were trying to redirect the students and trying to work on making those more specific, okay? So, for instance, the next time that Ethan, actually let me go with an exact example. Okay, so Ethan starts humming, right? The very first time, I go, Ethan were talking about norms and expectations or do I hear humming? and can I get you to stop humming, I need you to stop humming. And you were like, Are you good? You know, so theres like a lot of interchanging exchanges thats going on, right? So one thing I would like to see you do next time, just make sure you point out the specific behavior that you want to see stop and be very cautious not to phrase it as a question. So for instance, Ethan, please stop humming. Okay. So very short, very to the point or even saying like Ethan, can you please stop humming. Because if you leave it open, he may say well no, or I could but not right, okay. So how is that better just getting at the direct behavior that you want to see stop in the most succinct and specific, as brief as possible- Right. How is that better than kind of the back and forth exchanges you were having? Good. So theres no forms of miscommunication, he knows exactly what your expectations are and youre also not taking away so much class time and other students arent like, I cant hear you, I dont know whats going on, right? Okay, so Im going to pretend to be an off-task student. Im Cassidy, just as a reminder in case you forgot, i know you just met me, and I want you to try to bring me back in, okay.  So Savannah did I tell you- Good, good, I will that. So, please stop the side conversation, thats really good. But you could just say please stop talking. Also want to point out that the avatars are completely able to pick up the non-verbal gestures. So you could be like, Cassidy and like just finger on your lips, they can also pick up from that. Obviously you dont want to do that all the time. But you can like, throw it in a little bit, you know. Any questions for me? About things that- Right? Yeah, Just try to be as specific to the behavior that you want to see stop. And then also remember to try to be as succinct and brief, you dont have to provide them with explanations with why they need to stop. Because then youre also taking class time away, you just need to point out. Right? Because otherwise, its taking away class time and youre unable to establish the norms, right? Feel better? A lot better? All right. Well, if you need a moment to kind of regroup and kind of think through this, you just have a couple seconds left. So- and thank you. I look forward to seeing you go in there and try again. . Transcribed by Transcription HUB www.TranscriptionHUB.com"
transcript,2019_119_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"Alright. So, how are you feeling about Okay. Well, hopefully we can get you out in a little bit of time, hopefully we can you get going even more prepared for the next time So first of all, I just wanted to say that I really that you are able to remain calm and youre very collective and you kept being, just kind of pushing through even though they were throwing at you, and I really respect that. And, the other thing I would like to point out that I was excited about as I was watching you, is that every time when the speaker was every time it began, you were immediately keying into that and thats really important because that let us know that you already have a lens for acknowledging those misbehaviors as soon as theyre starting. I think thats really . So keep doing that moving forward and also you are making to redirect the misbehavior. But I think that thats where we have room to grow within this next simulation in making those redirections as specific as to the behavior that you want to see stop. Okay. So again, were going to focus on the specificity making it as specific to behavior. So, for instance, I want to go to an exact example, just so like we have some room for conversation. So theres a point about two minutes and where Ethan starts whispering And youre like, Ethan, could you focus back on the teacher please, well have lots of time to share about our personal lives later, right now, Id like for you to focus. What I would really like for you to do in that circumstance is to just be like, Ethan please stop . Like, just point out very specific the behavior that you want to see stop. And you dont have to say please but a lot of people feel like it helps them because then youre not like giving a direct command. But yes, Ethan, please stop whispering. So, how is that a little bit better than the exchange an ideas back and forth that happened between you and Ethan in that ? Perfect. I love that. So, there leaves like no room for miscommunication. And also, like youre not taking as much class time way  Yeah. So, you would actually have more time to focus on rules and expectations and also the other students will be able to be more engage. Because they kept giving you, like, I cant hear okay. So lets just do a little practice. Just to remind you, my name is Cassidy So Im going to engage in a misbehavior and Id like you to bring me back in. Did I tell you have known that ..  Okay. So I like that. Theres a couple of suggestions Im going to give so noticing you said that, you said could you please stop . So be very cautious of not doing that. That came up a couple of times during the simulation when you were pointing out the , but you were phrasing it as questions, then theyd be like, well I could but Im not, right. So just try not to phrase it as a question.  So, Cassidy please stop talking. All right. Also, another suggestion if you also, you can also use non-verbals to make it as like as succinct and as brief as possible. So, you could just be like Cassidy That would work too so yeah. How do you feel about that? Good. And yeah, so like I said Id just try to be as as possible and as succinct possible. So youre taking up, you know, not as much time. So, were good and were close to time, close to time."
transcript,2019_20_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"All right, so come on over. How do you feel that you did there? Do you feel- yeah, its a bizarre situation, I totally agree. Please dont feel like please dont be embarrassed with us, its just.  Okay, I understand that. The techniques that were going to talk about though should apply in classroom setting too. So, well go into it with an open mind, hows that sound? Okay, cool. So, I feel like you did, you actually really very well. I hope you walk out of that feeling bad. I know we can be all nervous, whats going on. I noticed that you were, you know, the behaviors as they were occurring and you are addressing them. The one thing that I would like see more when we go back in is being a little more specific in your interaction with . So, for instance, so one time that you did a really excellent job with this was, sorry, you probably heard me taking notes. When Ethans phone went off, you eventually got to the point where you said, Ethan, put the phone away please and the phone went away. And so, I want you to, kind of focus of being more specific with those redirections. So, that students know exactly what it is that you want from them in terms of behavior you either dont want to see or that you do want to see. So another example, lets see, so when Ethan was beat-boxing, you said Ethan, can you stop for a second. And he said, Im just beat-boxing. And so, how could you be more specific with him, if you wanted him to stop beat-boxing or start doing something else. Other than just saying, can you stop for a second? What will be a more specific thing that can say in there? Yeah, absolutely. Just naming the behavior, right? So just saying, you know, Ethan can you please stop beat-boxing. So, the way that you phrase it as a question, its perfectly fine. Just kind of naming that specific behavior there. So, let me come with another example here. Okay, so when he started to sing and I feel like your response, you know, youre being very amicable and friendly with him. You said, you know, you try to re-engage him and said, Ethan, how can you come prepared for class. And you said, you know, I prepared this little opera piece and you kind of hooked into that and said, okay, so, that clearly took a lot of work outside of class, you know, outside of school. So one way you can come is by putting a lot of work, you know, outside the school. But then he would he kind of continued singing. So, if you wanted him to stop singing in this scenario, what you could have said to him? Yeah. You could just say, you know, please stop singing and you know, making it, you know, still being kind with him the way that, you know, you had you seemed to be developing rapport with him, which is really great. So, I want you to continue to have that continue to have it developed rather. So, why is it better to be specific with students like in that redirections that youre giving them rather than saying, you know, can you please stop doing that? Making a more general statement.  Right. Yeah , exactly, it kind of removes that within that situation because, you know, please stop doing that can mean anything. And so youre naming a specific behavior that you either do or dont want to see for that matter. So, Im going to -were gonna do a little role play here. Im going to pretend to be a student in your class and I want you to use specific redirection with me for the . My name is Alex, by the way, just in case you forgot. Okay, you ready? All right, so pretend youre in the same scenario  Sure. And its just, right its just kind of a quick, you know, you didnt wait a long time to do it and let me go on. You let me to redirect or you rather redirected me pretty quickly. Do you have any ? Do you feel comfortable going back in, confident ? Okay. Yes, Im excited to see you be specific and timely again, you dont have to let them go on and on, kind of say just like you did there with me, kind of pulling back in pretty quickly. Sounds good? Okay, all right. Well, then well get you back in there."
transcript,2019_22_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"Just go ahead and take a seat. Youre fine. You dont have to worry about this. Thats just for if... Yeah. Thats just if its self-reflection. So Oh, thatsI was getting ready to ask you. How do you feelhow do you think that went? Bad? Okay, yeah. And thats okay! Its set up to make youyeah, kind of grapple with what to do. And thats all right. So, hopefully in the brief time that we have, we can get you feeling even more prepared and better, like, going back in. So, I just want to take a moment to point out some things that I saw that you were doing and that I really appreciated. So, first off, thank you for maintaining enthusiasm and being completely all the way throughout. Even though I know that its probably like the longest five minutes of your life. And then second off, I want to acknowledge the fact that you were continually recognizing the misbehavior as soon as it began. And you were very timely with that. And you were immediately trying toonce you noticed it, you were saying, if you ignored it, what would happen, or if you redirect it, how to redirect. Right? So, I think that to make your next even stronger, I would like to focus on making those comments that youre using to try to redirect the students, making them as specific as possible to the behavior that you want to see discontinued. Right?  So, Im going to go back to an exact example from, you know, from your last simulation. So, the second instance that second thing that happened was Dev started whispering and trying to distract Savannah. Yeah. He was talking about rocket club, right? So, some of the things that you said in that were like, hey, Dev, hey, is this a good thing to be doing right now? And you ask that question again a little later, like, should we be doing this right now because he kind of offered no response. And then, you try to, like, redirect by talking about establishing good routines throughout the class. Right? And trying to bring in setting expectations with clearly the fact that he was engaging in a behavior that you did not want to see him doing. Okay. So, one of the things that I want you to kind of do in those situations, is just to be like, Dev please stop talking. Like, just point out right away. The moment that he starts in the behavior, point out the behavior that he is doing that you would like to discontinue. So, be as specific as possible. And, as succinct as possible. Okay! So, why would that be better than what happened? Right. And I understand! This is a little tricky of a because you are like the first day and whatnot. So, I can totally appreciate that. But you also have to realize with really young , youre probably going to have to give them very specifics of like what behavior. Because I think there was one instance where you ask them to pay attention. I think this was Ethan, hes like I am paying , like, you know, like, because what it means to them maybe totally different than what it means to you. So just try to be as specific as possible. So, how about we kind of go through an example? Im going to pretend to be an off-task student. My name is Cassidy. And then I want you to try to model slash practice what we just talked about. Are you ready?   Okay. So, good. I really appreciate the way that you kind of got right to it. Couple notes. Be careful about saying can you do this? Right? Because then you leave it open to by asking a question. So, just be like, Cassidy stop. And, you can say please, it makes them feel better. Like, please stop drumming on the table. Also, you dont have toyou were going to by giving an explanation because dadada...You dont have to give an explanation. Like, make it as succinct and short as possible so youre not taking away class time from, like, what you need to do.  Okay! How do you feel? So thats intentional! Because a student is still engaging in this . Right? Yes."
transcript,2019_25_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,3,"So, how do you feel about that first go in the ? Okay. So, hopefully, I know we only have a brief amount of time, but hopefully we can get you go in more prepared for the next time. First off, I want to say that I really appreciate the way that you enthusiasm and you continued to be engaged. I know its really hard to do because they are trying to do anything and everything. So, thank you for pushing through. And then secondly off, I want to point out that its very clear that you already have a lens for immediately the misbehavior in a timely manner. And so, thats great. And so, keep doing them. And then, another thing and several that when the misbehavior occurred, you made sure that we were trying to redirect the misbehavior, you gave very specific commands. So, you gave very specific statements about the behavior that you wanted to see stop. So, I want to see you still continue to do that. And then, the other thing that I think that we can focus on is also making those redirections more succinct, moving forward. So brief, so theyre not taking up as much time. So, I want to go back to an example. All right. So, Im going to have like, the exact one. So, there was a point where Ethan was like beat boxing and youre, Ethan can you please stop making noise. And hes like, well, I could but I dont want to. And youre like, okay, please stop beat boxing. So, I want to point out two things. First thing, I love the empire where, please stop beat boxing or Ethan please stop beat boxing. The second thing is in terms of make room for , making that engagement and the back and forth between you all as brief as possible because it took a lot of time, right? So, why is that ? Why is it important to make it as brief as possible? Right, so that we can move on. But, also because like notice that the other students like, I cant hear you, what are you saying?  What do you say? Right? So, just take a less time to take one class time the other students are becoming disengaged. So, lets do like a brief practice. Im going to pretend to be a student whos off the task. And, I would like for you to try to bring me back in right?  Just remember my name is Cassidy. I mean, just not me. So Okay. Hey, Cassidy, could you look up here please and focus on me and stop tapping on the table so that I can hear you or so that we can hear you? Its okay. So, I want to point out a couple things. I really the way that youre like stated my name very clearly that youre with me. You got to the point where you said stop that, you know, kind of drumming and it was kind of hard because what do you call that in the moment? So, room for improvement, remember not to say can you please stop doing this. Right! Yeah, because it leaves it open to . I reallybut like I said I really like how you got the very specific behavior that you wanted to see stop. So, I want to kind of throw a perfect example since we have a little extra time. So, just keep in mind the facts that the specificity is so important because like for in some of your conversations you can try to look at back to the rules and expectations you were talking about does that look like respect looks like. And, students they have different interpretation for what respect looks like, right? So like, about putting out the exact behavior that theyre doing that you want to discontinue and getting right at it. And, so again, specific and as brief as possible. Some other tricks that you can think about that will help. It doesnt always have to be like, you everything. You could be like, Ethan, so nonverbal gestures are appropriate as well. So, just like any questions? I know I threw a lot at you in that short amount of time. Oh, well, I think you can do that, but just keep in mind that like your instance of the misbehavior are still going to occur.  You are still going to have to address those. But like, youre free to try a different classroom techniques or different routines. Just like, just going to happen over a behavior like, you have on topic that they cant do.  But I really enjoyed talking to you and I really hope goes better in the next round. All right."
transcript,2019_2_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,3,"All right. So, how are you feeling about that time? All right. Okay, so hopefully we can get you to feel a little bit better about that next time. I know it's very brief and we have very little time, but hopefully we can work on a couple of things. Before we get started I just want to tell you that I appreciate that you were able to maintain enthusiasm and just kind of keep pushing, keep grinding out. I know it's hard, theyre kind of throwing a lot at you. So, I very much appreciate it. Also, um, it was very clear that every time that one of the studentsof course Ethan and Devwere in misbehavior, you were immediately acknowledging and recognizing the misbehavior which is important because we know you already have a lens, kind of seeing right when its starting. The other thing I do want to point out is there were quite a few times throughout your past stimulation when um you did provide various specific um instructions for an attempt to redirect the . So, for instance, um, when Ethan started beat boxing, after a period of time, you said Ethan, please be quiet and he stopped. So, what I think would be most helpful for the sake of this next simulation and getting more prepared would be to not only continue to emphasize making those redirections as specific as possible, like you did with that one. Um, specific as possible in terms of the behavior that you want to see to , right? But then also as succinct as possible. So, in that last example that I was just giving you, it did take you a while to get to a point where you said like Ethan please be quiet, before that you were trying to engage him in the conversation like What do you think? He said, I don't know, can you try and then you were talking about how do we respect one another. So there is a lot of conversation that happened before you gave that specific please be quiet. So, we want to really try to shorten that time. Why-why might it have just been better to say Ethan, please be quiet up front? Its okay. So, I understand where you are coming from. And I can-- I can respect that, given that its like the first day, you're trying to build rapport with your students trying to establish relationships.  But for the sake of the simulation what we are trying to we are really trying to get at um, making sure that there's no in the behavior that you want to stop. So, you really have to be specific about that behavior, um, because I think there was another one like, hey, is your attention up here, are you focused and yeah Im focused, but Im focused on what I'm doing, you know. So, just be aware of that. The other thing about um, letting it go one kind of scaffoldingor I dont wanna use the word , but like starting at like a low grade and then kind of working up, is that you are taking away a lot of instruction time, right?  So, it's very distracting to some of the other students. So, just really try to get at that behavior as soon as possible so there's no miscommunication, not taking up a lot of time. I would just I have some caution there because real kids are going to push you a lot and just be aware of that. So, a quick practice, remember my name is Cassidy, I'm going to pretend to engage in misbehavior and I'd like for you to bring me back in, okay? Ready? Good. So like, if you--if you feel bad about saying like be quiet, Cassidy please be quiet, you can also useum, to make it even more succinct and um not take away as much class time, you can just be like Cassidy, say she was talking or, um you could be like Cassidy, non-verbal gesture or you could like kinda clap your hands together. So those are options too. Great. All right. You are up."
transcript,2019_30_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"Okay, talk to me about what you thought you did well and was easy and then what you thought was harder to do -- Well, thats definitely not true. Well, right I mean, Ill tell you what I think went well in a second because there definitely were things that went well. But, tell me from all the things that you feel like might not have gone well like, whats the most frustrating or biggest that you have. Youre talking about like proximity and things like that? Okay. Yeah, this simulation is not bad of course. So, things like, things went well because theyre definitely working very well is that you didnt give up on the behavior and you didnt just ignore it. Because youre trying to address it. And in particular, youre successful in addressing it when you told Ethan like, please dont beat box. And you told Ethan, please stop talking so I can continue the discussion. So, what I want to propose to you as a model for how my experience , and the way we talk about here is that, the effective are going to be as clear as possible and sort of concise, so a few words. Because you dont want to give a lot of attention and time to the misbehavior, but you do want to make sure that the student knows exactly what it is that you are expecting. So a lot of what youre saying about, like, Ethan would you mind waiting or can I have your full attention, like, made sense to me and I know why youre saying them. But there are things that students especially younger can be easily be confused by or not know, like, well I dont think usually, I dont know that thats you mean that I should not hum while youre talking or something like that. Does that make sense so far?  Okay. So what I want from the rest of our friend doing is sort of practicing some of those, like, short but specific redirections. And then if we have time we can talk about something else from the . Okay. So I will do a misbehavior and like youd just tell me specifically what you would like me to stop or what you would like me to do instead, okay? So the rude, a lot of people bring them up as mostly about tone of voice. Saying stop is not rude inherently unless youre like, yeah, there are other words that can be much ruder. So a lot of of voice but if the idea of stop makes you uncomfortable, you can start from a place of asking me kind of what I should be doing instead. So if youre talking and Im beatboxing what should I be doing? Listening in what way though? And thats what you need to say is to sound out because can be like, well, but I am listening. So try again with that word, silence like your friends as a teacher. Perfect. Yeah. And, sometimes saying that I need you or we are silent can make you feel a little bit less harsh than like stop.  But its still like concise and its still clear what it is that youre asking. Does that make sense? Yeah. Okay. So now, Im going to get slightly harder, Ill have you start talking, I will do a misbehavior. I want you to redirect me and then move on to going back to what youre talking about. So just be kind of just like I got it and move on. Does it make sense? Okay. Rose, I want to talk about vacation with you. I really, really No worries, want me to give you a suggestion for that word, or do you want to start over? Not listen but I need you to, you can say listen, I need you to listen and silently you should make sure about, like, the part but Im not talking... and gets into that.  And then, continue Yeah exactly. And so, that way youre not drawing and making it, because the more attention you give to something, the more students like try to do it and you move on, it doesnt take any time. So that is about our time. Any last questions or sentence that youre going to give me. Okay. All right. I know its late."
transcript,2019_34_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,1,"So, how are you feeling about that first ? Thats totally up to you. That piece of it.  Okay. So, one thing that made me so excited that I saw you doing consistently is engaging when- like you are noticing when a student is off task or distracting others. And I saw you like trying to engage and Im getting the sense that youre like trying to be kind and to make sure this is the first day. So, I would basically say like you be as direct as you want to be because what I noticed, to make to your simulation stronger, this next time, is that being really specific with a student about what you want them to do or not to do. So, for example, just like kind of, like lets not be distracting so thats a great because youre engaging with it, with them but that can like Exactly. Yeah, and think about like what do I want his eyes to be doing, what do I want his mouth to be doing you know like depending on the misbehavior. So, if you want him to like stop beat boxing, you know, it could be like, Ethan   So just being super specific so that theres no room for ambiguity. Im not being distracting. Yeah, exactly yeah. And then, I dont know if you noticed this but when you said lets put the phone away, he responded right away. Can you are you timing this? Can you tell me when we have like 30 seconds on the clock. Okay. Yeah. Okay, so Im going to be an off task student and I want you to practice like just being specific and you can either tell me what you want me to do or what you want me to not do, but just make sure theres no room for ambiguity. Does that make sense?  Awesome, okay. How did that feel? Really? Yeah, it can be hard to think of like the right thing to say. And also like, yeah I think like you can even cut it down to like, were not singing right now or whatever, if its like hard to be-- but lets do another one. Okay, how does that feel? I like the nonverbal. like I think that thats like the easiest and fastest way to communicate what you want someone to do  Okay, awesome. Im excited to see you try this. Yeah, have fun."
transcript,2019_35_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"First time, yes. Yeah. So, yeah, Im not But I feel like were getting some awesome stuff and I wanted to point that out to you   to make sure that the next time, it feels better. So, first in my notes, I wrote down that you were . What were gonna work on is being a little more . So, a couple times you said like, Ethan, stop or if you dont stop, Im going to have to ask you to take a break, or, Im waiting on you. Which are like so, so close to like the perfect thing to say, which is like a   specific enough to make sure that there is like no room for him to misunderstand. And so, basically, I would just add like whatever you want and to stop doing, so that its like really, really clear. So, like stop humming, were having a class discussion right now, or like, our voices are off right now. So that, he is not like oh, I stopped. You know, tapping but Im totally fine to keep talking uh-  Yeah. And so, saying something specific for each one, I think its like the best. I mean, it can be as simple as a , you can be like voices off or you can be like, hands . So uh, basically, the next time he does something like that, just being super specific so that like if you know on his last, because its like his first day, in last year, they wrote how to something like that, you know, like stop and he thinks, you mean I could stop talking or  . You could say something like Ethan, put your phone away, we   or something like that. Does that make sense? Why is that better than saying something a little bit more generic, like lets be respectful right now or were not into that that right now. Exactly. And do you know that sometime he with like I dont know if I wrote it down, that if youre like Im waiting for you, he is like Im ready, you know. So, he is like . Right. Exactly. Like he is not trying to be defiant, hes just like not totally understanding what you want him to do. Okay, so, like I feel like youre like so close to it being perfect because there are so many examples that of you doing an awesome job like at the very beginning, when he was humming, you were like, itd be great if you could stop during our discussion, and he stopped. Did you notice that? Okay. So, like youre doing it sometimes. Its just like it can be tedious. I encourage you to just keep it up. Okay, okay. So, lets wrap this. So, the next time, he's singing for example, you might be like, Ethan, our voices are off. So, Im going to pretend to be Ethan, and then, or I can just be   whatever you want and like in practice   . Okay, perfect. I like thatAnd thats awesome. I like how you are thinking like what should her eyes be doing, what should her voice be doing, what should her hands be doing. Thats perfect. So, then like Im being compliant with every piece that youre giving. How does that feel? Okay, yeah. Awesome. Do you have any other things you want to talk through? You want to do more practice? Okay. Sure. Oh, you say voices quiet, he would be like okay, Im going to quiet down Yeah, exactly. So, if you say quiet then it might get It depends. Yeah. So, what use a more  Yeah, that would be tricky but, yeah. But lovely, okay, yeah. All right. Youre very awesome. You got this, girl. Exactly. Can start."
transcript,2019_38_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"How are you feeling about the first simulation? Okay. So, thats totally fine. Im going to get you ready for the second one. Okay. So, one thing that makes me super excited that I felt like you were doing super consistently is noticing the behavior right the way like as soon as Ethan or Dev started doing anything you tried to engage right away which I think is great. So, like you are noticing and you are reacting which is one thing that we really want is to be timely and to think carefully about like, okay we are going to engage our students when they are off-task. The next round that you do I want you to focus on like telling the students specifically what you want them to do or not to do. So, just being like super direct. Okay, So, for example, in the last one when Ethan was lets just say opera singing, you are like hold on one second. And, what I think would be helpful to stop the behavior is being more specific about what you want him to do. So like what do you want his hands, his mouth, you know, like so that theres no room for ambiguity so that the kids arent like oh, well I am holding on Im just like singing while I hold on. Okay. So, the next time he starts opera singing or anything, pretend hes opera singing, I want you to be like Ethan voice off. So, like specifically telling him like really directly and you even use even use like a non-verbal. They will respond to a non-verbal if you use one. So, what about that, is like better than being like hold on one second if youre like Ethan voice off. Yeah, thats perfect because its like what are you doing with like your eyes, yours hands, your mouth. So theres no ambiguity. Okay. All right. So, Im going to be an off-task student. And, and Im going to give you an opportunity to practice  just so I know you feel really good about it before you go back in. Okay. So, pretend that Im Ethan and Im doing my Perfect. Okay. So, I really like that. I would even get to the like really specific stuff like right way. Yeah. So, like because you are taking time to like appreciate him and, you know, its like taking time away from the other kidsdos like engaging you, you know, like how Jasmine was like I cant even hear myself thinking. So, I would like get to it as fast as you can. And being direct is, you know, like hes not going be like mad that you are telling him to put his hands together because thats like a neautral thing So, lets try one more time. Okay. Perfect. I love that. And now you can immediately pivot into talking with the other students. Because you have like great ideas. Like I love that you went around and solicited information from them and then you are going to try to connect that to building the norms so like getting to addressing behavior faster will let you like spend more time doing that. Because I think that was great. You should feel really good about the way that you- you are obviously prepared, totally ready, this is a lot. So, dont worry. But, yeah just, I would just immediately just shut it down. Alright. Yeah. Do you have, we still have a minute so do you have questions or thoughts or do you want to practice anything else? Okay. Yeah. And, this is like, this is why we practice because its like, you know, you know exactly what to do. Its just like hard when you are like juggling like Im trying to, you know, create this space and, you know, interact with multiple students and I have this other thing happening over here. So, yeah, yeah awesome. Okay, youre going to do great. Yeah, of course. Were ready, yeah. Okay. All right. Yup anytime. Transcribed by Transcription HUB www.TranscriptionHUB.com"
transcript,2019_40_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"Oh, do you have no, okay, so how are you feeling about the first simulation? Okay. Well thats totally fine, its just practice and were going to use this time that get you feeling like, very good about your second attempt, okay? All right. So one thing that made me so excited that how are you doing consistently in your first round was addressing like, you are with the misbehavior like you are noticing it. You can you are not ignoring that its happening and thats like, super important because we want to make sure that kids like, know that we are addressing them, right? And so like I saw you make a face when Ethan started humming and thats important because you are already, you already have with the lens to the behavior when it starts. This time, I want to focus on being really specific and direct about what you want kids to either stop doing or start doing. And so like, think about like, what you want their eyes to do? What you want their mouth to do? What you want their hands to do? And like, leave no room for misinterpretation. So for example, let me just pull up my notes. In the last simulation when Ethan was whispering, you were like, lets be respectful of our classmates. Which totally make sense but leaves like, if you havent talk to a about what respectful means and what how we show it to each other than they might say like, I think what Ethan said which was like, I can be respectful, Im just talking to her about So if we are really specific and direct in what they want then but there is no room for misinterpretation. So for example, so say Ethan start singing again. Next time he does that, I want you to say, Ethan voices are off. And so, like knows exactly what you want to stop and use that a non-verbal to like, reinforce with him. Or if he is like , you could say Ethan, our hands are folded on our desk. Is that makes sense? Okay. So why is that better than said just saying like, Ethan, we are not doing that right now? Yeah, exactly. Sure. Yeah, you could totally start by saying that and then you could even answer with some non-verbal to reinforce. You could be like, so if, if you are not doing that I might, you know, show you this to reminds you. Because most of what hes doing, right, its like, it doesnt seem like hes purposefully derailing but he just needs a constant . Okay, so I want to practice so that you feel really good. So Im going to like do some off task behavior I want you to try and be like, super specific with me. You are ready? Okay, alright. Ethan. Yes. I could be, I could be Savannah if you want. Okay. Whoever you want me to be? Perfect. Did you how does that feel? I kind of feel like you feel weird about it. Okay, lets try it again. And I would just like instead of, like get the language so that you feel like you can just throw it out there, like I would say voices are off or you can even just do that without having to say anything. I need you to be just like Savannah- do you know what I mean? Okay, are you ready? And then you can all turn in, keep having your . How does that feel? Okay, good. So maybe the non-verbals are your thing  Okay, alright. So Im really excited to see you try that. Is there anything else we have like a minute left? Is there else we havent talked about in this simulation? Yeah. So when theres all this other stuff going on, its just so hard for them to engage because they are like, you know, I think I cant remember if somebody said I cant hear myself think. So once you get the behavior under control, like whatever strategies you want to do, you could call on them. You can say, I havent heard from, you know, Eva or whatever you want to do? It will be a lot easier once there is like, less distraction. Do that make sense? Okay, it does. Do you want to practice one more time?  Okay, lets practice one more time Perfect, you are so ready. Alright, have fun its going to be great"
transcript,2019_41_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,3,"So, tell me how you think it went and what you thought that maybe you did better than the last time that you did?  Okay. Im glad that it was easier. And Im going to and there is like a lot of really great things that Ill tell you about and then well find well pick one thing to focus on. . And I saw a lot of great things. Sorry, Im like still getting . . So, the first thing that I thought that you did really well which is really important is that you address every single and you address each behavior right away. You didnt like talk try to talk over students or ignore it and thats super important. Keep doing that. Maybe you did that every single time, which is great. The second thing that you did really well is that you had a really calm like positive tone every time and I really liked that you even after you address Daves behavior, you said to him that you asked him a question so you brought him back into conversation. So, thats also awesome, keep doing that. The thing that I want you to work on today is not something that you did wrong, but that you did inconsistently. . Sometimes you did it sometimes you didnt. So, for example, at the beginning, when Ethan was humming, you said Ethan, can you stop that, please? And then you said Ethan, can you stop making sounds humming, please? So, between those two things, can you stop that and can you stop making those sounds? Which one do you think its better? . Exactly . Yeah. So, the thing that I want us to work on or for you to work on for next time, it is just getting that shorter more one right away and not saying anything else afterwards. . So, the other thing that I saw is that one time you said, hey Ethan, can you stop talking to Jasmine please? Which is perfect and he stopped. But then you said so that we can focus on the norms, which I know you were trying to explain to you why its important. But thats when that you can do if the students continually misbehaving, you can do that as a private conversation . But what you dont you dont want to extend the time that the behavior is taking up the class and its getting more . . So, you have all the language that you need. Youre giving creditors, youre just adding other stuff. And I just want you to take that away and focus on the ones events. And the last piece is a lot of times you asked a question and that gives you for the student be like, no, I cant stop. So, you just want to rephrase it. . Yeah. And you can still use please, thats still a polite thing to do. . All right. So, Im going to tend to be Ethan for a little while. I will do only one thing at a time I promise and I just want you to practice responding to me the ways that we just talked about. . All right.  . Yeah.  . Great, perfect. . Exactly. A good thing that you can add on it and you can think about if you want to is that you dont feel like youre saying stop, stop, stop. . Is that instead of telling you what not to do. You can tell me what I should be doing? . Like, okay, attention. . So, but in that case, dont worry about it too much for the simulations, I dont want . . So typically, what I would say is something along the lines, Ethan, please sit silently. Its that you want him to just not be making the noise. . Yeah. But please, please stop whatever is original way to do this. . Do you have any other questions, we still have a little time. Questions for me or things that I can help you from . Yeah. So, do you mean like acknowledging it when she first says it or do you mean. I think, so all the lines thats not the focus of this coaching conversation so, I dont hav I have my own opinions from what I was teaching about the research  . . Yeah. But thats basically the [overlapping ] ."
transcript,2019_42_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"Aside from terrible, before I tell you my feedback tell me what you think either like, if you do think it was it was so . What do you think made it that way, what would you do get or maybe find something what you did well? Yeah, for sure. And don't worry about those things because that's what most people look like when they come in the simulator. So, what I do want to say is that, I think you did a really great job of making sure that you've responded to all the behaviors. You did say and you didn't just ignore it, and that's like the first step is, you have to notice what's going on and say something about it. So, you're on the right track. The thing that I want to focus on for our coaching session before you go back into the simulator is around what you say and how you say it when you talk to Ethan. So, you were right, you notice that you had you said a lot of different things trying to get attention. Hey, Ethan Im waiting, hey, Ethan and then quite a few times you asked would you mind and then, you would change it would you please. So, what the goal is, is to kind of say what you need to say but as short as clearly as . So, there's no long conversation back and forth where you say things like, well I am very respectful or I wouldn't mind, all that takes time away from class. Does that makes sense? So, can you try thinking of a plan like doing ethan is doinf what can you say to me just really short and simple to get me to that? Yeah, perfect. Yeah. So, you can as you could say what you want to see from me, you can also tell me what you want me to stop doing. So, in this case you would say Ethan Perfect. And that's all you need to say. You don't need any of the would. Would you please or would you mind that because you don't want to give that extra opportunity for students to argue with you. And you don't need to say, hey, Ethan, and wait for his . Most times students are very interested in what the teacher is . So, they might purposely not respond to you but they're usually paying attention. It would be only the case if, if you would say, just Ethan please stop drumming and it looks like they really aren't paying , then you can repeat it or So, at that point, you maybe want to make sure they heard you, right? So, that's the point so that it can be done and you can do here in your classroom, you want to be like in proximity closer to them, that kind of thing. But start from the assumption that they are paying . Because most kids are aware that what they're doing is not right necessarily. And so, they're there they are waiting to see what the teacher's going to do especially on the first day of class. They could be testing the boundaries something. Okay, so we're going to do some practice in a second. But before we do, just remind me why is it better to have like shorter, clear answer then . Excellent. All right. I'm going to continue to the Ethan first and I want you to respond to Never going wait to actually I dont know the words to this song What was the problem here? Yeah. Thats right. Excellent. You can say please, thats okay. But you don't want it to be a question that because then my answer can just be no which is what you want to avoid. So, please is fine, smiling is good. Like, you don't need to be like angry and you even don't want to be angry or negative about it. You want to have like the positive effect. You just don't want to get emotion. All right. Perfect. Yep. All right. You feel good?  Questions for me? Like when they should be listening to you. You can go like this or you can say stop talking or just stop talking honestly should do. Okay. All right. You got this, simple and quick."
transcript,2019_49_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"What did you think about the first simulation?  Okay, thats totally fine. Its just practice. So, lets use this time to make- to get you feeling prepared for the next session. So one thing I think   youre doing is like trying to set up expectation and consistently noticing when the was starting. So, like   when Ethan started humming and I was like this is the part that shows me direct with on is the notes. I know yeah, but that was tricky. But this time I want you to focus on being really specific and direct with students with what you either want them to do or want them to stop. So, for example in your last simulation, I noticed when Ethan had his phone out you said, Alright, why dont you put the phone in your backpack. Do you notice that he responded right away at that? So, that was perfect. And so, taking that kind of directness and really like that level of specificity to the other interactions.  So, another moment when he was, I think it was Ava I think, you were like, why dont we give somebody else the turn to make noises now. I know it, that was like this ambiguities  Yeah. Yeah, but youre right. I mean its true because in the previous year maybe like, you know Yeah, right, lets just start with that, right exactly. And so, just keeping in mind that like he wants to behave , you just have to be super   So, why would something like voice off, hands together with like a nonverbal, whys that better than something more general? Perfect. Yeah, exactly. So, a lot of times when we tell students to just stop, they dont actually know like which piece to stop or how to reengage. And so youre totally right like giving them something specific, then they go oh okay, I can comply because I know what to do. Okay, so Im going to be an off task student and you can before you go back. Okay? Great. I love that. So I like how you thought through like what should my hands be doing, what should my hands be doing, and so that like at each stage I knew how to re-engage. So, when you said voices are off, I was still doing this and I knew that hands together and then Im like, okay, all pieces of this are matching that. How did that feel? Yeah? Okay, good. It can be tricky , but like its so hard to be direct with kiddos because like, then youre able to have this like more collaborative discussion that-. I can tell you if I find out and like want specifically So, yeah. Awesome. Is there anything else you want to talk about before you go back in? No I think that a lot of times when there is other noises that they are just like, its hard to engage or I think  Yeah, exactly. So, thats the kind of thing where its like, dont feel bad for turning the behavior off because then youre making the other kids feel better involved on their first day  I think its going to be great. Just be super , direct and then you can Got it."
transcript,2019_50_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"All right. So how are you feeling about the first ? Im sorry   I just have to ask and so lets use this time today feeling better so that the second time it goes better. Okay, so one thing Im so excited that I saw you doing is like you are trying to set up norms and youd be like super positive of the student which is awesome and I dont want you to stop doing that, okay? Thats so because like that was you sort of a framework to be really with kids about what you expect. So this time what have I focused on is just immediately redirecting anything that you would, any , so for example when Ethan was beatboxing, you said right we are going to respect when each person is talking which I totally get what you are saying but because the first day that that would needs room for , right? So it may be respect like last year and there are other classroom meant that like making noise was within that relm. And so basically what I want you to work on is being as with what you want the students to stop doing or to start doing. And think about it like even with what do you want their eyes to do, what do you want their mouth to do, what do you want their hands to do with, the misbehavior is like being like super unambiguous about why you have to do. Does that make sense? Okay. So for example next time Ethan is like singing for example, you could be like Ethan voices are off. Does that make sense?  So thats like a non-verbal which is great because its still like within, I feel like your general vibe is being very, like you are trying to set things up and you are kind and theres nothing like unkind about, you know, creating classroom space that is conducive to that . So, using a non-verbal can be a great one or just saying like short and to the point as like our voices are off . Okay great! If hes like using his hands to beatbox or to drum, you could be like our hands are folded on the desk. And those are things that so that one is like our hands are folded on the desk and thats like what you want him to do and voices off is something that you dont want him to do or something that you want him to do also, but you can also be super direct with like what you want, like Ethan stop talking, you know, which like totally depends on whatever, like works better for you. Just be as super clear as possible. Does that make sense? . Okay. So why is that better than saying something like, lets be respectful of each other right now or something? . Yeah, exactly. Especially on the first day, its to like define that word together, yeah. Okay. So now Im going to because I know that this can feel weird. I want you to practice with me before you go back into the . Okay, so Im going to pretend to be and off-task student. And I want you to redirect my behavior, okay? . Its Emily. Okay, so Im going to pretend to be  Perfect. How did that feel? Awesome. .. to being told, yeah that make sense. But I I agree to that like I like that youre noticing that because it definitely was like there was a lot of lead up  and you noticed that like when youre like hands are on the desk, yeah like that could still mean that hes singing so that I like how do you followed up with our voices are off. How much time do we have left? Okay. Lets do one more just in case. Yeah, I feel like that could okay, yeah like let outside conversations Yeah, something like that. Lets see it one more time because I want to make sure. Yeah, lets do it, all right . Yeah and then what if he is like, what was he doing? Oh my gosh I forgot. Oh, like I have a rule we should have our phones out and be texting Perfect. Just something that is super specific, I think you got it. All right then, how do you feel? This is going to be great, yep. . Five more minutes. This is going to be awesome. Have fun. Okay."
transcript,2019_54_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,4,"So, you probably heard me clicking away over here. You really knocked that out of the park. Yeah. How do you feel? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think thats a really good on it. You definitely used that word, I think, to your throughout, which is really great. So, awesome. Well, lets use this time now to kind of tweak, you know, tweak a little bit there. But, you know, one thing that I really want to commend you on is how specific and succinct you were with your redirections. So, just, you know, a couple, and kind of going with that, you know, when Ethan started humming, I think at first you thought he was singing which is understandable but then, you know, once you realized he was humming, you said Ethan stop humming, it will distract your classmates, you know, you were right to the point. At another point, lets see. When Dev was talking about Rocket Club, you know, you got to the point you said Dev, stop talking about Rocket Club, were moving on, right? Just kind of, like, very, very to the point there. So, really, really nice job with being specific, so your students knew exactly what behavior that you wanted to see or not see any more and being . You didnt really drag your redirections on, on and on, which would kind of suck up class time. Going ahead, though, one thing that I want you to do is kind of focus more on your tone and your body language with when you are giving these . And, you know, one big reason for this is that we dont want to, you know, feel ostracized or like were picking on them, you know. Being a teacher sometimes I think kids can kind of get that . And so, certainly thats never our intention. So, lets see. One time. Okay, so. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that one, you know, because you even said, you said, hey Ethan and, you know, it took you a second to realize what he was doing. You said stop texting, put your phone away, please. And so, by adding that please and then you said thank you, that was really good. But with some of your other redirections, you didnt always say please or thank you. And so that might be a way that we want to tweak it. For instance, lets see, when, yeah, so going back to the Rocket Club thing with Dev, you said Dev, stop talking about Rocket Club, were moving on. How could you reframe that to be a little more positive in your , or in your reaction? Yeah, absolutely. And you dont even have to you dont even have to kind of say all that, just kind of adding the simple please and thank you and, you know, but, yeah, of course saying thank you when hes done and smiling a little bit and even, like, when you watch your tone of voice, okay? I could hear you getting a little there, so you kind of just want to watch that because your kids will definitely pick up on that too. So, how is saying, you know, Dev, please stop talking about Rocket Club, thank you. How is that an on Dev stop talking about Rocket Club, were moving on.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I like kind of, youre pointing out like that, the kind of like reciprocal or like, relationships that you want to have there. Right on. Very good. Okay. So, what about when Ethan was humming and you said, Ethan, stop humming. It will distract your classmates. How could you change that to be a little bit more positive? You can even just leave it with that. Ethan, please stop humming. Thank you so much for doing that, you know, just very simple to the point. We dont want to drag on our redirections. Alright, so before I send you back in, Im going to pretend to be a distracted student, and I want you to redirect me. So, just a reminder, my name is Alex. So, just pretend that Im one of your students in the class. You ready? Okay. So, I went to the beach this weekend and it was like totally awesome and I just had the best time and I just think everyone should go to the beach. It was just so sunny. I got a great tan. It was awesome.  Good. Very good, yeah. And, again, you just want to make sure youre real specific with that. So, right, please stop talking about the beach, were going to talk about classroom norms.  Awesome. Cool."
transcript,2019_58_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"Alright. Nice job. Like so many questions for us to answer, before I even talk to you. How do you feel about the first ? Yeah, yeah, and of course proximity and those things are still great and important to use in the classroom but right, it's not possible to sort of model that right there. So, what I want to talk about today is I saw an interesting progression where you got better and better but for the next one, I want to see you to do the things that I thought were great but consistently. So, the two things that I saw you do that I want you to continue doing are to address the behavior like right away as soon as you notice it. The first one he was humming for a little while Before you did, and all the other ones you like said something right away, so keep doing that. Yeah. So, there's two parts: one is yeah, it could be bothering other students. The second part Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just sort of general like it's not really an appropriate thing for a student to be humming over a teacher kind of thing even if it doesnt bother you . And then the third piece is that if students are able to do small things, then they could and nothing happens and that's often when they choose to escalate and then it will get to a point where it's easier to fix it earlier rather than later on. That's a great question. So, early and right away and then the second piece is making sure that what you say to the student when you are addressing the behavior is as clear as possible. So, , I think there was one time where you said, Ethan, like stop singing, something like that. And that was great. And he stopped right away. But there was another time at the end where you said Ethan, tell your voice to stop, please. And Ethan was like voice stop, right?  So, you want to make sure that what you say is as clear so, that kind of thing doesn't happen to students. I promise you from my experience, because they will like take any of those opportunities to do that with you. So, what can you could you have said to Ethan instead of He was singing. Yeah, exactly. As simple, as short as possible. As an alternative, if you find yourself saying stop, stop, stop, all the time. You can give the reverse, which is to tell them what you want to see. So, what do you want to see from Ethan in this situation? Yeah, one positive behavior, yeah. And I would you to use silent rather than quiet, because well, Im talking quietly right now, there's a risk that you run when you say quietly. That was like a big thing when Im started teaching. Yeah, so, and then the want part that was like my phrasing, but you can just say, Ethan, I need you to sit silently. Yes. Sound good? Okay, I'm going to be Ethan, for a little while. I'm going to do some different behaviors. They might be similar, they might be different and I just want you to respond as quickly as possible and as clearly as possible. And remember, you can tell me what to do or what not to do. And it's the same sort of situation where what I shouldn't do. Okay, so . Excellent. And you can add like, please or a smile, something that sort of indicates you're not upset with them, right? You're just like, very matter of fact, this thing just So, there is a face, but not a voice you never want it to be mean voice. I dont know if this is the space that I can, like, get into the face thing. Yeah, I dont have a good answer. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. And some of that is just the practice I'm picking up the kids that it works for and the kids that it doesnt work for. Some kids will need a smile and some kids will need something more severe. But, for this case, don't worry so much about the facial other than the smile. You dont need the severe part, especially because its the first day of class. Do you have the time?"
transcript,2019_5_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,1,"Yeah that can be tough. I totally agree. Usually the avatar thats talking will move alittle bit more so keep an eye out for that but I totally understand that. But so you feel pretty good otherwise.  Yeah. Awesome. Why, I think you did a really good job. One thing that I want to commend you on is that you are definitely noticing the when they were occurring and so thats really good because a lot of teachers wont recognize. Wont even recognized it. And so its good to look at students, you know, when they are engaging in behaviors that we dont necessarily want to see because it kind of signals to your students that like, hey, you know, I see you like maybe we should be changing your in some way and so going ahead, like when you go into the , I would love to see you be a little more timely in your . And so, you know, one example, you probably heard me taking notes over here, um let see when Ethan was humming and you couldnt really tell to who, you know, who was talking but he, for the good, good, , kind of continued humming through. I know you noticed it happening but you know, you went on and said, all right class, so what are we going to do today? We are going to set some norms and expectations for the classroom and would anyone like to begin a about what we expect for norms in the classroom to be. And go ahead and raise your hand to see if you like to contribute, Ethan, do you have something that you would like to add. And so this is kind of, your way of like, being like I know you are humming, like I see you doing that but we want to make sure that when we want to see certain behavior from the that we are, first of all, direct and kind of quick about it  That way they dont kind of continue going on. So, you realize that its like coming for a while there. So, I want you to be a little more timely in your redirection. So, if Ethan was to start humming, how could you have been more timely with redirecting him. Youre right. So, but with that I actually, you made a great point where you say, you know, stop humming. So, it sounds like youre kind of worried about finessing the way that you are redirecting students. And so, is there a way you can say stop humming in a nicer kind of more congenial way to the student? But if you do that kind of you say, oh, Im doing well, just continue humming, Right? So, whats this specific behavior that you want to see or not see anymore? Right. So, how can you redirect him? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, a lot of people are little worried about, like, hurting students feelings. How could you say, how could you redirect him with what you just said, in a kind way? Perfect. Please stop humming so we can talk about norms and expectations, thats perfect. And again with that timely piece of making sure that youre not letting him hum for thiry seconds. and you did do this by the way with when the cellphone came up. Right of the bat you said, what is that you said, Okay, Ethan, how about you put your phone away so we can talk about the norms and expectations. And that was perfect and you did that Awesome, okay. So, lets practice be in timely and . Im going to pretend to be a student. My name is Alice by the way. Okay, ready? All right. Oh, sure, okay. And see, so I know that exact behavior that you want me to stop, okay? And you do that in a very kind way to be as perfect.  Okay. So, how do you feel? You ready? I think you got this. I think you definitely got this. "
transcript,2019_61_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,3,"Go ahead and tell me your thoughts about what went well in the simulator and what you feel good. Okay. I mean all really good things to think about and like the right questions to ask so we can use this time checklist. Before we do that though, what I want to first tell you about today Im going to keep with the first thing I want to say is to tell you what you did well, which is that youve made sure to respond to every behavior. You didnt just like, ignore them or kind of talk over them which was great. So I want you to keep doing that and now well spend the rest of the time talking about that kind of tone of voice and wording and when to respond.  So for that last part, you should respond right away. The more that you let the behavior go on, the more that sends the message that hed think its acceptable sort of like and you dont want to send that message, especially when its a behavior thats like could be of other students learning. So as soon as you notice it, thats when you want to say some good norm in terms of what you say and how do you make to stay calm. So the fewer words that you use, you send more of a message of like this, like if you used to if you talk a lot about it, then youre sending a message of like, this is a big deal and Im taking a lots of energy and that makes it feel more dramatic. So, you want to add that gives you more chance to, like, be emotional. So, do you want to make it not like quick like talking fast but like few words and that will help you with some of that like just say it simply and move on. Oftentimes if you smile when youre saying if I can help with the positive tone. So lets do Ethans on his phone, right? All right. So Im Ethan on my phone, try to tell me what I should do. Perfect. Yeah. So that was nice and short, you didnt ask questions or be like because all of these, you know, yeah perfect. Do you want to try it again and add a little more positive tone for me.  Yeah, perfect. That is often like a nice way to begin.  So you can smile at the end also and saying thank you is reasonable. And then, you want to make sure that you quickly moved back to what youre saying. So it doesnt feel like you took the whole classes attention to, like, lets look at Ethan and what hes doing, should let can we do that and now were moving on. So now what Im going to ask you to do is, I want you to talk as if youre leading the discussion and Im going to misbehave while youre doing that. So like, you have to manage that kind of noticing me and responding to my and then going back to what you are trying to do. Okay. Im not going to do the phone one. Ill do a different one.  Try it again but focus on the not singing part rather than the because it lets get back to this discussion, I can be like well Im contributing to the discussion cause Im singing.  Then? One more time with a slightly more positive tone.  I know its hard. But like the positive tone was one of the things that I had to spend the most time like thinking about all the time when I was because its easy to get frustrated when you lost control   Perfect. And then keep on Excellent. Okay. We have about a minute left, so we can either do more practice or if you have questions so far of the things that you want to discuss. Yeah. So the answer is, its possible there might be certain kids that thats true for. In my experience, especially like on the first day of class or like yeah, towards the beginning before you norms, the positive is typically good for everybody. Because youre still clear, right, youre not saying like, dont sing. But you should as long as youre not being confusing, youre being clear about what you want, then students understand and you can always, if the behavior keeps going thats when you might need to change your tune. Does that make sense? Good question, though. All right, you got this. "
transcript,2019_62_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"Yes. Hello. So, how are you feeling about your first simulation?  Really? I know, yeah. Okay. So, hopefully were going to have a kind of really specific strategy for you to use in the second one so then youll feel like super comfortable. So, one thing that makes me so excited that youre already doing consistently is like noticing and engaging when theres misbehavior. So, thats super important because like you want to make sure that kids know that we can hear them and that they being and so engaging right away it was like is a super, a good so keep that up. But this what I want you to focus on being super with what you want them to do. So either what you want them to stop doing or what you want them to actually do. And think about like things that you can tell kids as about like where should their eyes be, what should their mouth be doing, like where should their hands be? So, for example like in your last simulation Ill just pull out right now. I noticed that you said should we bring our phones in class. Right, when Ethan pull out his phone. Which is like Im glad that you notice hes on his phone and try to address that and a more like way to deal with that might be like just saying Ethan phones are away. Or we dont have phones out in class, put it away. And, being super, super direct so that theres no like room for ambiguity. Because that especially the first day of school maybe last year kiddos were allowed to use their phones, you know, thats been long or whatever. And so, just being like really clear about like this is me, this is my expectation and Im going to be very direct about it. So, next time say Ethan is like singing his opera music, I want you to just say like really specific. So, you could be like Ethan voices are off, like you could use a nonverbal or you just say specifically like our voices off. Or could just beat boxing you could say like our hands are on the desk. Does that make sense? What did you, like why is that better than engaging with him in a conversation about the misbehavior? Exactly. Yeah. Did you notice when, I forget which one he said like he was like well, its just hard for me because of his opera da, da, da, you know, which is like Exactly, yeah. Perfect. Okay. So, now were going to , Im going to be off task and I just want to make sure you feel good about doing this. So, well just do a pretend. So, Ill pretend to be Ethan Okay. Well, what if I opera sing? Okay. Does that make sense? Do you feel good doing that? Okay. Good. Awesome. If youre like, its especially, for the first day of class it can be like you want to make sure you say something with it at first Or if youre like our voices are off then like they might even like the next time it happens- Yeah, you dont even have to say which is awesome too. So, feel free to use nonverbal. Yeah with hands sometimes I was always I would be like, you know, like which can be but as long as you introduce it. Yeah. So, I liked what you are saying like first it like you are like quiet to a specific students and you are like I havent heard from you guys. I think like once you get the behavior under control then there will be so much more like air time available. So that when you are using this idea you, while you are using like it might be more successful. So, when it is, when there isnt other things- when theyre arent other things happening like and you call on Jasmine shes kind of going to be like super receptive. But I think that thats a great , you can like I havent heard from you. Do you want to ? Because they are sometimes the conversation gets dominated by other people so I think its really good to notice that. And I love that you notice that and youre like engaged with it despite like the fact that theres all this other stuff happening. So, yeah. Anything else? We have like 20 more seconds. Yeah. Let just be super specific and direct. Yeah. Great. God bless. Yeah. Perfect. All right. Thiss going to be awesome. "
transcript,2019_65_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"These kids are wild. All right. Its hard. Its hard not to laugh. Okay. How are you feeling about the first simulation? Okay. So, hopefully we can get you feeling even more prepared for the next go-around. But there are some things that you did really, really well, and Id like to point those out. So first of all it was very evident that you are recognizing the behavior like the moment it starts, youre picking up on it. Its just we have to kind of work on like how were kind of to it. And so, youre trying to redirect, which is all really great things. But were just going to kind of talk a little bit more about how we can redirect in specific and succinct ways. So, I just want to kind of like give you an example of something Im thinking about. So, for instance when Dave starts talking about the rocket club. This is like the second instance of , and youre like I would love to have that conversation later with you. And then you were trying to move on to other students to kind of see like if you continue the conversation about setting classroom norms. And what youd rather discontinue. And youre finally like, can we talk about this later, but just if we can focus on a very specific behavior that you would like for him to discontinue. And then also trying to get there a little quicker, then that may be a good thing for us to put this on.  So, I kind of gave you an example about what with Dev in your last simulation. So, for instance the next time that Dev might start talking you would, an option for you to make that response more would be like, Dev I need please I need for you to please stop talking. Okay and make sure that when you say like that, saying please makes it sound a little less harsh but you also want to be direct and dont it leave open as like a question.  You know, like can you please stop talking because nobody would say no. So very direct So how about we practice a little bit of that. So I am going to pretend to be an off-task student. And I would like for you to respond to me. Are you ready?  Yes, its Cassidy. I was thinking about that.   So, if youre pointing out the behavior then thats going to go a long ways as compared to like, oh, we can talk about that at lunch, or trying to ignore them because it was clear that you were picking up on it, you were just kind of hoping... And thats okay. So how is that better than, so we kind of talked about this. Then how is like being direct, pointing out the behavior, exactly the behavior you want them to discontinue, a better option than kind of not pointing it out directly. Right? So youre telling Ethan, or in this case Dev, the exact thing that you want to stop, the exact behavior that you want to sop. And it also, its not taking as long to get there.  So the other students who, like Ethan said I cant hear you. Theyre not being as distracting. So, how about, we have a little bit of extra time, so how about we practice one more time?  You ready? Okay. Okay. Good. You dont have to say please. Its just some people feel like giving a direct command is a little much for them. Please and a smile makes it feel a little better. The other thing that you could do to like make it more succinct too at times, if you notice that Ethan is talking a lot, you could be like Ethan . So, you could also give non- verbals. So you could also give  Okay. Sounds good. Okay. Thank you."
transcript,2019_66_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2," All right, so how do you think that went? What do you mean never great? Well there was one redirection that you used twice that actually worked quite successfully, you remember what it was? Quiet hands quiet mouths? On both times you use that that was successful Yeah. So, that idea that this was all not working- do rest on the fact that you did have several examples where you actually did work well. So, lets try to replicate more of those. So what Id like to have us focus this conversation on is for you to be more specific with naming the student, naming the behavior, then naming the redirection. So like for example, the phrase, quiet hands quiet mouths, does that specifically identify a student thats potentially not following that advice? It does? If I just say the phrase, dont forget our expectation, quiet hands quiet mouths. Not just a little, yeah. I mean, so as soon as you see something, so for example, Ethan was beatboxing. What can you say to Ethan that is specific that redirects his behavior? What do you think? So can you see them? Hell be like, yeah, you can see my hands. So what can you say? Ethan, hands on your lap. Eyes on me. I mean, so youre identifying the behavior that he is exhibiting, specifically to him. And then youre providing him with a redirection. So then what would a non-specific response look like if I was texting? So whats an example of a non-specific response? But from you. Uh-huh. Perfect, great. So now you can flip that and say- what could you say now thats very specific to redirect my behavior or excuse me, to stop the behavior and redirection him. And just eyes on me? Right. But what are you also trying to do at the same time? In general, what are you trying to do? Yeah. Youre trying to teach a lesson. So in terms of trying to invite folks in, Im totally with you. But its a matter of like, if youve got 16 redirections that you have to get through, you need to make sure that each one is succinct. Yeah, so sort of the next step of that would be in addition to being specific, its being succinct.. You know, so the idea of like, if you see a cell phone for example, you could then say whats a specific response? Uh-huh. And then to be short you can be like, Ethan, cell phone in your pocket, eyes up on me. Uh-huh, just real quick. All right? So then what would a non-specific response look like, if I was whispering to Jasmine and if my name is Ethan? Perfect. So how can you make it more specific? Okay. Even faster, what do you think? So just please be quiet, name the behavior. 8] There you go or just voices off. Something- thats just a matter, so again, those best, sort of three step formula of name the student, name the behavior that you want them to stop doing. And then offer them the redirection that youd like them to do. With me so far? Okay. So then lets practice for example, if I am Jasmine and if I am doing one of these things. Whats an example of a specific response if Im Jasmine? Your phone where Im sorry? In your desk? All right, okay. So again So youve got the formula, so again, the name, youre naming the behavior that you want to see stop. And then youre offering the specific thing that you want them to do, as opposed to that more general expectation piece, Okay? So now lets hear you try it with lets say, Ethan starts doing an impersonation of somebody, what could you say? These are things that I love, I love doing impersonations in the classroom. This is- Okay. Or you just say, Ethan no impersonations right now, voices off, eyes on me. So youre naming the behavior. I mean, as you can get a sense of it in civil environment. Alright, so do you feel comfortable? With these specific responses. What are the elements? We have the name. There you go. Im excited to see you try it. . All right, lets go. Im feeling good."
transcript,2019_71_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"Okay so how are you feeling about the first ? Okay so do not feel bad about this. So just but be a little bit more prepared for the next . So first of all I want to announce the things that you have done really well. I appreciate the way that you were able to enthusiasm and continue to try to redirect the behavior that was in the classroom. It was one of those times, it was very evident that every time the students were engaging in this behavior you were immediately picking up on it so that is important because you were that behavior as soon as it began. Like the very first instance of Ethan humming whether it was just like a little small in the beginning to redirect. So thats really important. I do want to point out that there were multiple times when you were again trying to redirect them. So I think in terms of making this next simulation even , I really want to focus on making sure that those comments that you were saying in an attempt to redirect the behavior are as specific as to the behavior that you are seeing occur. So let me go back to an example that happened so alright so actually this is not the first one. This is the second thing that happened. So Dev was talking about the rocket right? And he was trying to distract Savannah, and you know I mentioned how you would think for everyone to kind of be on board to say like Dev, there was this kind of, they were engaging in a exchange of conversation, sorry, and then you said well have time at the end of the class and then you had to kind of redirect them, well talk about this later just trying everything, right? And then you even mentioned like having to sit in the corner if they dont calm down, so one of the things that I would like for you to do in that situation is just be like, Dev, stop talking. Stop distracting. You know stop distracting and you dont even have to say it. You can just say stop talking. Okay. But why do you think that that may be better than the exchanges that happened in your previous simulation?  Exactly and also think about the time that you are taking to try and redirect them, and how its taking so much class time, and Savannah even goes I cant hear what you are saying, so less distraction for everyone.  So how about this? I am going to pretend to be an   student and then you try to redirect me, okay? Alright, ready? drumming, making noise? so one of the things, lets try one more time, Im going to do something else, ready? Savannah, have I told you about -- Good. I know thats a harsh but yeah I see what you are saying. So I appreciate you directly stating in a specific way a behavior that you would like stopped. Like I said some people have a hard time with issuing a command without saying please, so I understand if you want to say that Also keep in mind that the avatar is a simulation, I dont know what they can do. You can use non verbal gestures so . Okay thats one of the ways to give a very statement to kind of put a behavior to stop in a very succint way because then you are   to make them realize what you would like them to stop doing. Yeah. Just remember to state their name first okay. Does that make sense? 02] Okay, any questions? Okay, awesome! Its alright."
transcript,2019_74_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"All right. So firstly, how do you think it went?  Okay. So what do you mean by horrible first of all. Lets just, were practicing. So, when you talk about horrible, what do you mean? Yeah. So, little frustration from what youre sharing! One of the things that I saw that I really liked is that on occasion, you did get him to what? You did get him to listen and pay attention. Yeah. So, there were some successes and so the goal of this conversation is for us to talk about potential strategies that you can use to be more more often. Okay. So but again, one thing I was excited about is that there were glimpses of that. And so, lets build off of that. So, one of the things that I saw is that you recognized when Ethan was being disruptive or when Dev was being disruptive. So, thats the first step is to be timely with your responses because what are you trying to do? Right. But even more general. You are trying to... Yeah, youre trying to teach, you know. So, you are trying to move through the lesson. And, youve got disruptions and issues along the way. And so, your goal is to try to find a way to be quick with them so you can keep the flow going with your own . So, one of the things that I liked, as I mentioned, is that you are very timely with a couple of them, with recognizing them. So now, what I like to focus most of our conversation was being specific. All right! With your redirections, all right! So, how can you be specific in a redirection if I do this? Lets say, my name is Dev. And, if Im doing this,  how can you use, to be specific in redirecting me? Well, begin. So, Im Dev. All right. Also, you might be like, Dev can you stop beating on the table. How can you be more specific? How can you be?  Yeah. Perfect. Yeah. So you even then, so now were the response even further to make it more succinct. Alright. So thats like what we want to go down the road. Keep that really tight, but rather than saying can you do that, can you do that presents an for them to not do that. So, an example of that or the redirection would be, Dev  so lets hear again.  Okay. And then, what can you do to confirm?  That he doesnt start doing that right down there. So, you told to stop. But what could really prevented from even more in the future? Where are his hands to be? Yeah, very good. Great. All right. So, lets try it again. All right! Because we have those two segments, you had a name, stop the behavior and then you are going to offer the redirection on what youd like Dev to do. All right! More specific. Perfect. So instead of lets, because thats , because that sort of disperses the burden around the class and you are concerned about Dev. So I know there are some cases where youre like, I would want to be, you know, I dont want to name a student or call them out but you have to read, you have to name a student in the first place if you want him or her to know that youre actually talking to them. So, Dev, stop beating or drumming on the table, hands in your lap please. So its, stop this, Id like you to do that and there we go. Because its one thing to stop the behavior. Its another thing to actually tell the student what you want him or her to do. Okay! So, how about what would a nonspecific answer or look like if I was doing ? Whats a answers or redirection? Mm hmm. Excellent. Okay. Not specific at all because he could be focusing but he just does it to drum. So, you want to name the . So, name the student first name, name the behavior and name the . Okay! So, lets try a different one. Alright. So, lets say that I am still lets say I am Ethan and start doing this. And, I want you to give me a specific redirection. Savannah Great. Okay. So, weve gotso were halfway there. Perfect. So, the first thing you did was asked me to do what?  Perfect. Youre good, so, you asked me to stop talking. But then what position am I still like? So then, whats the next thing you need to do?  Uh-huh. Even quicker you could just be, Ethan eyes on me. Yeah. So, it could be something real quick Ethan voices off, eyes on me. So, its real quick, because you are going to have five or six that are going to keep going. And so, the sooner you can go around and put out the fire to that. Okay! So, were going to focus on being specific with the naming of the behavior and then you are going to be specific in your . Make sense? Okay? That make sense? So, what did you say? You can just say, Ethan voices off. Because thats for a sound. Because he might be humming and then youre just like, Ethan voices off please. Because then that  Okay. Im excited. Now again, really specific."
transcript,2019_75_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,3,"Alright. So, how do you feel about it?  So what does that mean, explain the rationale?  Sure. So, the types of norms? Yeah. So, one of that was like, so I saw you moving through that conversation, which was great. But a couple of that that conversation was tripped up by some of those behaviors.  So, how you think you did with redirecting from Ethan and Dev. How do you feel about it? Sure. Right. Very correct. Yeah. So, one of the things that I saw is that on several occasions you were very timely or you just hit it real quick. So, as soon as you heard it, or as soon as you saw it, you identified the . So, then the next piece too on occasion you were with the redirection. There are sometimes where you get a little bit more vague. And then, there were even a couple more times where you really tight with the whole redirection. So, an example of a really tight redirection that you have thats specific and quick is, for example, Ethan phone away eyes on me. Very quick, its very specific because its step one phone away, step two eyes on me, and your succinct as opposed to, what would be a non-succinct response to that? If I am Ethan and if Im on my phone, whats a non-succinct response that you can recall? Right. Or something like, you know, were not to be doing things right now that are distracting. And, is that with what hes doing? No. So, good. All right. So, then why dont we with an example of you being succinct, and then specific and timely. So, were going to keep going on specific and timely. And, I want to really focus on this very tight redirection. how would you direct that? More succinct Stop what? On the There we go. Alright. So, just be very specific because when I stopped tapping this is general. So, because what are you trying to do for the rest of the time? Yeah. So, youre trying to move through our lesson. And so, the quicker that you can identify a behavior, name the student, tell them specifically what you want them to do and do it quickly the sooner you can do what? The sooner you can continue with the lesson. So in many ways, like over and over your training, what we are preparing for is that this just becomes second nature where you might have seven or eight , for example, in one minute. And, you are still able to proceed through it, because you are redirecting while you are continuing to move through the lesson. So, why is it beneficial or why is it beneficial for a succinct response based on what weve talked about so far? What do you think? Right. Okay. So, lets try one more time. So lets see, how would you respond if I started doing this.  How could you be more succinct? What would you like me to do though? So is that , were not having conversations? So how could you, what do you truly want me to do? And? Eyes on me. Because Im looking over here. Im talking to Savannah, for example. So, you need to be called me by name. And then, the first thing is voices off, eyes on me. Or stop talking please. Eyes on me. So, Im with you on the call out piece about naming that, but they have to know that youre speaking to them as opposed to the general we. Does that make sense about trying to avoid the word we? So you want to again, be very specific and then try to be very succinct. Okay? All right, So, really excited, to see you be succinct. Weve got great examples of the timely and the and so were going to push you to be more specific, timely but then also very tight about those redirections. Sounds good? All right."
transcript,2019_77_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,3,"All right. So take a seat. Im sorry to interrupt the on hold. All right. So, how do you feel about that first ? Yeah, but   see what you can do. So its okay. Hopefully we can get you able to get you to be a little bit more prepared for the next one. And then, we only have a very brief amount of time. So, well do, well try to focus on what we can. First of all, I want to point out some things that I noticed that you were doing really well and I just want you to know that I appreciate that youre doing them and keep doing them. First and foremost, very much appreciate that you were able to maintain enthusiasm and kind of push through. Like I said their a lot out at you. So, and you remained calm and corrected the entire thing. So keep doing that. Secondly, it was very clear that every time a was happening, you were keying into it like immediately. So thats great because that us know that you already have a lens to kind of a misbehavior as soon as it started. And then the next thing I noticed that you were always attempting to in some way redirect that . And sometimes those redirections were very, very specific. So, for instance, there was a point in time with the phone, youre like, Ethan put your phone away. It was very specific of the behavior you want to see stop. There was another time where you told them that you wanted eyes like turned or their eyes and ears focused on you, mouths close. So, thats really important because its letting us know that you are already giving redirections that are specific to the behavior that you want to see or that you want to see stop. So, keep doing that. So, for the sake of the little bit of time that we have in coaching, I want to try to focus on not only to make those redirections very specific but also as succinct as so that were trying to take away as little class time as . So, we just going to -- Im going to pull up an example. So, for instance when Dev starts talking about Rocket Club, theres a point where youre like Dev, I think that Savannah is trying to pay . That sounds really cool but thats an after school activity right? Youre having this kind of like back and forth exchange with him. I think that thats a great idea. And you try to get into later like how this is kind of establishing a norm, when someone else is talking, they need to be listening, and then you finally get to the point where youre saying, I need for you to stop talking to your classmates and have your eyes and ears on me, which is very specific. But, I want to push you to not use the word like, I need you to do this. Because as you know, thats why they were kind of pushing back on you a couple times when you did that, like you need me to, what do you mean you need me to? Right? So, youre like, you know, Dev please have like, youre like, in this situation you talk to him and just like, Dev please stop talking. Just kind of how you did with the cell phone, right? So why might that be better than that back and forth exchange that happened when Dev started talking about Rocket Club? And I also noticed there were a few times like the other were like, I cant hear you. Whats going on, right? So, it also shows that you are able to engage with the other students and that you are what they have to say and their input. So, yes to make sure the other students are able to take part. So, Im going to pretend to engage in a misbehavior. And I want you to try to bring me back based on what we talked about, okay? My name is Cassie, in case you forgot. Are you ready? Okay, Savannah, did they tell you about when our parents have.. Good. So, I like how you told me to please stop talking. You didnt have to give me an explanation. You didnt have to say like look up after, you could just say, like, please stop talking. So, make it as succinct and brief as possible, you can also give them nonverbal . You could be like Cassie... Yeah. So, and thats kind of some ways to still make it and obviously thats not going to work with all of them like with the cell phone but youre still being very specific but also trying to take up as less class time to deal with the misbehavior as possible. Okay. So, that was an example where you said, Ethan I need you to do this. So, if you were just saying please stop humming. Also be very cautious not to phrase as a question. Like, can you stop humming?  Just to make sure you say, please stop humming.  So, its very specific, very succinct. I think were out of time. Im excited to see you in the next round. ."
transcript,2019_80_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,3,"Well, it definitely showed. But I do everyone has to spend some time thatll hopefully get you feeling better for the next go-around. So, first of all, I want to point out some things that you did very well. I really appreciate the way that you remained calm and enthusiasm throughout the entire course of the simulation. I know that's hard to do when you're trying to interact with these avatars. So, very much appreciated. Also, I was really excited to see that like, for , as soon as Ethan started, like, humming, you picked up on that like right away and you are acknowledging the behavior as soon as it began, and then kind of working towards the ways to redirect that behavior. So, for instance when Dev starts murmuring about rocket club, youre trying to get him back on task kind of right away. So, one thing I think that will be very helpful to help us moving into the next simulation to make it even would be on, when you are trying to redirect the students after a has happened, making those redirections more succinct.  And brief. So, for instance, one of the things I noticed that you were doing quite often was that, you would say like, can you please stop doing this? So, be cautious of leaving it open to a . Because they're a little generous so that could go down a path of like no return. Okay. So another thing, so that was in one of the instant one of the instances, one of the things that you were kind of saying a little bit, but one of the other ones I kind of want to get into as well, the first time that Ethan starts humming, youre kind of you the behavior but you are kind of ignoring a little bit. You kept talking about expectations and you were getting into like, when when someone is speaking, what are we doing And then youre like, Ethan, you know, could you please could be, you know, be quiet. It took a really long time to get to that point where you were like, pointing out the behavior that you wanted to see, right? So, what I would like to see you do like for instance that Ethan's humming, just be like: Ethan, please stop humming, like just point out the direct behavior. Well you could say be quiet, either one would be okay. But like when youre saying humming, its like also the direct.  Pointing out the exact behavior that you would like to see stop but be quiet is fine. And, also, you could, you could give nonverbal clues so you could be like Ethan. The avatars are okay with . So how would that be a little bit better than kind of what happened that first instance with the humming? And like try to the conversation but... So that is part of it. The other part totally, the other part is that by taking so long to get Ethan to stop, to pointing on the specific behavior that you want it to stop. Think about how much class time was spent taking away from the other students. So you want to make it as succinct, you want to address it, redirect in as succinct a way as soon as possible.  Okay. So let's do a little practice. Im going to pretend to be like an off-task student okay and you kind of tell me or me okay, you ready?  Okay. So I like that. That was very nice and kind, you know. You dont always have to be so. Its always nice to say please because then you don't feel so bad but like, if you feel like you just need to be like stop, you know, stop, you know, for me drumming.  Also I know that you just met me so you probably dont remember my name. Thats fine, so just like, Cassidy, please stop , or I asked you to stop drumming. Done. Okay? So it's definitely harder when you're in a classroom. And you will know your students better, right? And you will know what's happening. But for the sake of the simulation, what we would like for you to do is really to practice with pointing out the behavior that you would like to see stop. And then we can see if we could get better reactions. Okay? All right. Go and set up."
transcript,2019_81_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,3,"So, how are you feeling about that first simulation. Oh my gosh. Perfect so, okay. Yeah, I know, I think there was a lot that you did really well. So, like for example, you said things like, Ethan, please put away the technology. And did you notice that he put it away, right away. And you were like, Ethan, please remember to have a quiet voice. So, you were like, really direct with him and you were super calm. And then like when you were able to redirect then you would like facilitate the discussion. Thats awesome. I feel like there were a lot of really great things. The only thing I would say is just being like a tiny-like tweaking your language a little bit. Like when you say like, quiet down, I dont know if you noticed this but he said like, oh, then Ill like whistle more quietly or something like that. So, instead of quiet I would say like, our voices are off or you could even just use a non-verbal if you want. Yeah. Because I think like all of your redirections were really short, they were like very direct and then I would just like anytime, theres language thats ambiguous, he could interpret it, however he wants. So, just being really like whatever you want him to do or to stop doing, making sure that theres no that its like crystal clear. But yeah, I feel like that was great. For sure. So, Im going to be a misbehaving student and Im going to let you practice on me with that specific thing in mind before you go back in the simulation. You ready?  Awesome, that was perfect. So, like when you said turn your voice off, I was still going to keep going, but I love how you were like yeah, and put your hands on your lap. So, youre like, youve thought about like what my mouth was doing, what my hands were doing. If theyre like turning away from you, you could even be like eyes on me. So, just making it clear about each behavior. But, yeah, I think that was awesome. Why is that better than saying something more generic with them? Like lets be respectful or lets pay attention. Yeah. Because its like the first day, right. So, like respect, might look different to different people or paying attention in last years class might have, you know, it might have been okay to be moving around or making noise or whatever. Do you have anything else you want to troubleshoot? No, no, thats a good point. Yeah, maybe like pull out the most important piece or you ask them like which one do you think of those -that list you gave me, is the most important one. Im trying to remember when they were off-task- I mean, when they were giving off tasks suggestions, uhm like when Dave is talking about Rocket Club, oh you, were like we can discuss that after class. I would say something even more specific than that, because I feel like in that case, he was like, well like did you notice that he was like, oh well why after class, or I forget what he said but that would be like, Dev our voices are off unless were on topic. Something super explicit with that too. But is that what youre talking about like when theyre giving lots of suggestions for the norm? I dont know, I would just say like or you could like pose it to the other kids like okay, Savannah gave us two, should we pick one, should we pick both? Something like that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, thats a good question. If theres any misbehavior happening, I would just address that first. And then, if they are still not really responding, I would just call on them directly. Uhm in this case, because theyre not like, real students, like I wouldnt worry about  time. Yeah. Because like I think like, if theyre not participating, it could be because the misbehave is distracting them. You know what I mean? So, dont wait for it but stop it. And then, start the conversation again. And if you need to like transition quickly like youre like voices are off, hands are together and then you could be like Savannah, whats a norm, you know, so that you can just immediately jump back in. Yeah, I think thats a good point. Yeah. Have fun."
transcript,2019_87_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,4,"What do you think you did well? Yeah. So, I noticed a lot of times you would give them I assume what you mean by giving the opportunity is sort of saying like, do you remember what we just talked about or were you listening? And then, you would if it kept going, you would say like please stop this. Right? So, I think its a good idea and sentiment that you want to sort of give them the opportunity to correct their behavior and not embarrass them... Interviewee  Im also thinking that its the first day of school so theres like, no rapport between me and them, and that, like, we just met each other. Sure yeah. So, I understand like why youre it that way. What I want to encourage you to do is to take the thing that youre doing really well, which is at the end, youre saying really clearly, this is what I want you to do, or this is what I dont want you to do. And, actually just use that from the beginning. And whether you want to sort of like build rapport and keep things positive, thats about the tone of voice that you use when you give them the direction, and then what you say afterwards. So, ideally what you want to do is if Im talking about, hey class, remember what I said about norms and you start banging on the table, I would say hey, hey Abby, please stop banging the table right now. Abby, do you have any for norms, and so my whole voice is positive, Im not like, Abby youre so terrible or anything like that. And then, Im including them, Im making sure that Im bringing them back to participate in the , so they can see like no big deal, like you just did what you needed to and we moved on, kind of thing. And thats the best way in my as a teacher and that were sort of taught to teach you here to sort of say like, protect their feelings, but still make it really clear what it is that you want. Because a lot of times, students misbehave and have more problems when theres less clarity about what they want. And when you ask the questions and you give them a choice, you have the that you may end up with just a lot of confusion, and kids can take that and be, like, well I am listening or I dont want to. And, so it makes it more constant, does that makes sense? Alright. If you would start talking, so that I you.  What was the first part you said? I would like you to please stop singing? Okay. So, I want you to cut out as many extra words as possible because the more words you have, the more chance for them to... Yeah. Or you can say my name. Ariel, pleaseyou can use please, please stop singing. And, I know you want to explain to them like, this is why Im telling you. But dontdont spend all the extra time explaining. Does that make sense? Alright. So, dont worry about talking, Ill just say la, la, la, la. Perfect. Okay. Now, Ive told you why I thought that was better but you tell me, why do you think it would be more helpful to have just a sort of fewer-words response. So, I understand what youre saying. And I think that youre putting a lot of tone into the stop that doesnt need to be there. And I promise you I used stop talking all the time with students. And as long as you do it calmly and with a smile, positive and bring them back to the conversation. It isnt abrasive and it ends up being its easier for them to save face. Because its less embarrassing because then they dont feel like theyre being lectured at. And they have to respond to you and be like, Im going to win this argument. If youre just say it and move on, then they have the choice to behave or not behave. If they dont behave at that point, thats like a whole other, you know, call a parent or a  , like other type of thing. But that way youve given them the chance to just like quickly fix it and move on, and it doesnt have to become something bigger. Does that make sense?  And totally, definitely dont, you dont want to be like stop talking. For sure, for sure. Thats super important. Does that make you feel a little bit better about what Im asking? Alright. You got this. And it will help the stop faster too so you dont need to get to that stage."
transcript,2019_89_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"How do you think the first simulation went? And thats okay, so hopefully just in our brief amount of time that we have, we can get you going better prepared into the next . First of all, I want to point out some things that you are doing really well. I really appreciate the way you maintain enthusiasm and you kept pushing through even though the students where throwing a lot at you. I know that its really hard to do in school and do you think, you need to need to be shown appreciation for that. Also the other thing is I was really excited that every time students started to engaged in some kind of misbehavior. When it was, when Ethan was starting to beat-box or when that was going on, you were immediately picking up and recognizing those . And it was very clear that you were attempting to redirect the misbehavior. So, I think one thing that we can focus on forward and that would make the next simulation even stronger is making those things that you are saying in an attempt to redirect, making them as specific as . So, take you back to an example really to update. So, for instance, when Ethan song goes off, right? And you immediately keyed into what was going on but you had said that Ethan, do you need to take a break. I need you to listen. Are you ready to learn? How can you be ready to learn? So you are trying like, bring him back in so it was clear obviously you were acknowledging what he was doing was not appropriate. I mean that you later said that no technology in class and then the next misbehavior just kind of started with the singing. So, what I was thinking that we can focus on is that the next time that Ethan, for instance, was starting to answer his phone you could just do like, Ethan put the phone away or Ethan can you put the phone away. And there is sometime people dont like it, the first where they feel like, its more of a command but you do want to have a strong presence and point out the behavior that you want to stop. And so let me ask you this, why would that possibly be a better way of dealing with it upfront than what happened in the first simulation. Right. And also I think about the fact that during that whole encounter and he like, you know, when hes like saying all these things or you know, whichever incidents we want to look out, you know, whether its humming or beat-boxing or whispering or whistling or like that. I mean, any times that how much time is taking away from class and how much time students are saying like I cant hear you. So, obviously, if you be a specific as possible in addressing the behavior that we want to discontinue and then also as succinct as possible, okay? So like addressed moment and then make sure the way youre saying and dont take a whole lot of time to say it. So, lets do a little practice for a moment, just a reminder, my name is Cassidy. So, Im going to pretend to be an off task student and feel like, free to address me, okay? Okay. Cassidy, no drumming on the table. [00; So, Im giving you a lot. So just try to think of making as specific to a behavior and as succinct as possible. Were done so youre ready to start back in."
transcript,2019_91_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,3,"I thought you did great, so you dont need to worry. How do you feel about it? What do you think? What would you, how would you like it to go to make it feel better to you? Yeah. So, in a real classroom situation  You can move around. Here, you cant, but tell me why you were thinking, because you said a few times to Ethan, like, do you need to take a break? Tell me why you were thinking that? Yeah. Yeah. That part makes it tricky, yeah. So, what it sounded like to me is that you were getting a little bit more agitated as Ethan did And so, I do want to say you did a great job of being calm at the beginning. The first couple you told him what he needed to do and he did it and that was great. And then, I can see that as he was to do more things, youre like, why is this kid like still doing more things, right? But it is the first day of school, so yeah, like under the assumption that he doesnt know necessarily or hes testing out or he just like as a kid, he gets easily distracted. We want to make sure that we stay calm throughout. And even for kids that are purposely doing it, the more you give them emotion, the more theyre going to do it. Thats the attention piece. So, what I want you to work on for next time is making what you say as like close to when he first starts the behavior as . And as short in words as possible. Because the more that youre talking about like, remember what Eva just said and all this, the more and time youre giving to him. And a few times you were like talking over while I think he was talking, and you never want to be in a where youre talking over your kid. So, what I want to practice islets see. So, lets talk about Dev, because Dev was, like, on and on about Rocket Club. And youre like, youre really interested in talking, do you want to share it with everyone? What youre saying to think of an , and I can see why you wanted to like, give him a chance to fix it or connect it. But what you want to do is, kind of like establish really clearly, this is what the line is, so that kids dont have that room to be like, oh, well, Im just like talking about Rocket Club. I dont know, whatever. So, what could you have said instead to Dev? If Dev started to talk, whats like a one sentence thing that you could say to get him to stop? Yeah. When I was training, they encouraged us to use the word silent because quiet can be like,  so you can just say Dev, I need you to be silent. And you want it to be quick but I want to make sure, not quick like you say the word like, Dev be quiet, but just that its short and succinct, because I had a few teachers before that were to speed talk their kids. So, dont do that. Okay cool. Do you feel good about the change that Im asking you? Okay. Why do you think thats better to give that, like, shorter sentence? Yeah. And you did a really good job when you said about the quiet or be silent and being really specific about what you want to see, and not saying something like, be respectful. Which I saw you do a little bit later but you noticed that like, when kids are like, well I am being respectful. I dont know what that means. Okay, so Im going to be an annoying kid for a while since we have two minutes. Youre going to telling me what to do or not to do. Is that what you want to do? Ask me a question?  Okay, try again. Yeah, and what could you specifically tell me not to do? Yes. And I noticed a few times you had hand motions, which is excellent like keep doing that. Alright, Im going to try it again but this time I want you to be in the middle of speaking, so it really feels like an . Yeah. And then you can also just or whatever, was that the hand motion that you had? Something like that. Yeah, those are great. I think were out of time. Sounds great. Alright. You got this. No questions?"
transcript,2019_94_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"Well, how do you think that? I've got notes on my end but I want to hear from you first. Okay. So, tell me Okay. Yeah. So that I agree with you about that trying to move through the setting up the norms piece in just a short time period and stuff. You have five minutes to do that. One of the things that I saw that I really liked when we had some particular troublemakers with is that you identified the behavior and asked them to do what? just stop the behavior. Yeah, so that was one thing that I want you to keep doing as we move forward to the next conversation in the next is that you are very specific with naming those behaviors. Okay? So, we'll use that first but I did notice that it took a little bit of time for you to address some of those behaviors, and then the that you use were pretty vague. What was an example of a redirection, do you think, to get Ethan, for example, to stop some of his behavior? What did you say, like, what actual words got Ethan to stop? Yes, thats very specific. So that's what I'd like you to do is during this next conversation is that you are timely for the most part to recognize them. But so make sure you, as soon as you see some , the next part of this is to be specific with naming the behavior and then getting the student a specific action to do so. So what kind of an issue can we get when you say remember our classroom rules of not talking while others are talking, does that specifically name a particular student behavior? It doesnt stop Youll get there so how could you then instead of being more general in that response? How could you be more specific to me if that behavior to nip it in the bud. So, let's say for example, how about I model something? So, let's say I'm doing this  and Im Ethan. What would you do to get me to stop doing pretty quickly? Okay, what's even quicker? Thats right. So, I can see you specifically named Ethan, and then you told him what to do, you get in the action but it stopped. All right, let's try another one. So, let's say I'm doing this, and I'm also Ethan. Okay, how would you sure that even more? Go to Ethans eyes on you. Okay. So, look he doesn't know where to look, but eyes on me so that would redirect Ethan from whatever he's doing down here or if you think it's his phone, Ethan, please put your phone away and eyes up here on me. So, something like that as well. Okay. So, what would a non- look like if I'm doing this? So, here if you are trying to go through it, what would a non-response on your part look like if I'm doing this? What would you do if you were not responding to this misbehavior?  You wouldnt say anything. So one of the things I want us to practice on during this next simulation is to get very timely, where as soon as you notice something, but then more importantly be specific. So, you are naming the action and the students to try to get them to stop the behavior so you can do what, to kick off. Yeah. Alright. So, how about well how would you respond to if I was whispering to a friend? Okay. Eyes on me so again, focus on being timely so as soon as you potentially notice and hear something just real quick Dev voices off, eyes on me. So, something just very simple for them. Okay. Any questions? Just real quick. So, the purposes of simulation we're just looking for management within the class. So, ideally outside of it yes but for the purposes of this we are just looking for timely like again and redirection. Yeah. So, Dev, phone away, eyes on me. Im excited to see you try it. Okay. Alright. Ready? Okay?"
transcript,2019_96_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"Alright. So, one thing that I know and love about you is that you are a very kind and gentle person. So, I love that you are doing like, you are starting with the least invasive, you know, like you are like Ill ask something for the whole class before I call out a specific student. But, when youre seeing misbehaviors at this level, like dont be afraid to be super direct and specific. Does that make sense? So, even more specific than that, so like either exactly what you want them to do or exactly what you want them to stop doing. And think about like, where do you want their eyes, what do you want them to do with their mouth, where should their hands be. like really specific yeah. Right. So that you can like, at least regain the conversation. So, then you can like cultivate a more- like a space that would- Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And so like, in this case, like did you notice when youre saying things like, I need you to be paying attention. Ethan would say something like, I am paying attention, Im just beatboxing, while I pay attention. So, because its like the first day of class and maybe- Right. And, maybe thats a side conversation you have with him like after class, you know, like if this werent a simulation- But, Id do something as like simple as being like Ethan, like our voices are off right now and just moving on- So that you can have the discussion. Because I feel like youre not able to like- Its overwhelming. Yeah, for sure. But did you notice- exactly. Did you notice when you said all of our devices are going to be turned off during the school day? And he put it away! So, that was like an example of like, it wasnt as specific as like our voices are offering now. But you gave them a reallyyou told them exactly what you wanted him to do and he did that. Right. So, hes like not being defiant but hes just, hes a wiggly kid, and youre right like you would have to like come up with other strategies outside of the class, outside of the exact classroom like, to fix it like and I know that you would like to be really thoughtful about that. But because its like day one and you want to have a discussion- Youve got to shut it down. Right. Just try not to- Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I think because it really helpsit helps guide them to what they need to be doing. And I mean, I think this is like I'm glad we are having this conversation because I feel like most kids should understandd that. My expectation is that when I say pay attention theyll just kind of pay attention. Like, they dont need that extra support to get to paying attention. Yeah. , Right. Right. No wiggle room. Right. Emily, soEmily, its not appropriate for us to be boom-chicking during class. Emily, I need you to pay attention and I need you to stop boom chicking during class. Okay! Thank you. I want you to stop moving now too, we are not going to be moving. We are not going to talk and were not going to sing. We are not going to sing. This is a situation where we are trying to be calm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Emily, I need you to stop what youre doing right now and I need you to focus and pay attention. We are not going to be moving. We are not going to be singing. You are going to focus with your eyes on me, your mouth off, your ears on and you are paying attention to me. Okay. Ears on and pay attention to me. Okay. Okay. Emily, can you look at me please? Emily, look at me please. I want you to stop what you are doing. I want you to stop what you are doing. Good. Thank you. And, I want you to have your eyes on me. We are not moving right now. We are going to look at me and we are going to pay attention. Okay! Stop moving your hands. So, just say that, stop moving your hands? What you want them to do! Okay. So, I could say like, Emily, I want you to stop moving your hands and put your hands in your lap. Okay. Emily, now I you to keep your hands still and we are not going to talk. Youre going to keep your mouth off. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense."
transcript,2019_97_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,3,"I can tell that youre a little bit frustrated about... Yeah. You know, I understand, and thats just a limitation of the simulator But I will say, so I was a teacher for five years before coming here, and there are times where you are, like, across the room and its not logistically feasible to like get closer to the kid or to ask them to leave. So, like, the type of things that you can do here, even though its not the only things that you would do, the things that we are trying to get you to practice are still things that you will use sometimes and that will be helpful. Sure. I know, Im not advocating that you would yell, like its not about raising your voice. But like when you talk to students, youre often like, theres just a room of students, and you cant always go across immediately to them, especially if youre in the middle of direct instruction. It just gives more attention and more time. If you interrupt yourself, walk over to them, correct them, and come back. So, its actually much more efficient and it sort of moves on and makes them less embarrassed if youre able to give them a short and quick of what the behavior should be. And then, they can just kind of move on and say things. So, especially if youre worried about like what youre saying, one of the easiest and best things to do is nonverbal . So, going like right Yeah. Yes. Right. But, when you start, when youre on your first day as a teacher, you will have to manage the classroom, and you dont know whether or not likeand I know it feels like hes doing so much stuff and its like a lot, but I definitely had days where kids, especially if you dont address the first behavior, where kids will continue to do more and more things. And, it can easily get frustrating. And, the more tools you have and the more comfort you have with, like, what you can try, you know, definitely uses those other tools that youre learning but the more that you have a wider toolbox, the more likely you are to be able to address it for whatever that kid needs and sort of move on successfully. Does that make sense? So, a lot, so the thing that I wanted to focus on for the coaching is a lot of your conversations ended up being like a back and forth between you and the student or you say, hey, Ethan Im waiting for, to get their attention. And, what I want to encourage you to do to not use so much instructional time and to make it quick is just to say, hey, Ethan I need you to be silent right now. And thats it. Move on. Dont keep talking and engaging with him. Then, you have a whole other conversation, but this practice isnt aboutbut at the moment So, its possible that you can just repeat that. Like, I would give twice at least. Like, please be quiet or please be silent. And then, if doesnt then you can talk about but I dont think there were any times that I sawthere were a few times where you were like please be respectful or you sort of made general comments. But you can specifically say please do this, that might be where it felt like you said something. You can also tell them not like, like what not to do. So, you can say Exactly. Yeah, if thats more comfortable for you, then use that. And then, just leave it at that, give the student a little bit of time to show that they heard and corrected before you keep talking. Otherwise, they are just going to tune out. It just takes more time and you get worked up. The more you talk about it, the more frustrated, not you ... Well, this is just meant to give you that...  Alright, so Im going to pretend to be...  So, start talking so that I can interrupt you and get that practice. The other students? What do you mean?  Oh, they will but not if someone else is talking because they cant hear. Its like if someone else is misbehaving, they get distracted by the misbehavior so thats another reason that you should be making sure Okay. Alright. So, leading class norms.   No question, just stop because you dont want to give him the option to say no I wont do that. Yes. Just nice and simple and move on and that way you can move past that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that was the end of the five minutes. I mean, you can go up there and take a minute and like think about what we talked about. I justwe cant continue to have like..."
transcript,2019_98_5C_Transcript.txt,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,"Sit down right here. Okay. So, so how do you think that went in terms of your abilities to redirect Ethan or Dev's ? Okay. Why do you say that? Okay. All right. So, let's use this to try to decrease the number of times that keeps happening.  One of the things that I saw that I really liked is that you keep your cool. Okay, that's the first piece that can really throw people off when they have a lot of redirections they have to do is that they can lose their cool and then what is a likely consequence of that. As well. So on both sides, yes, what they'll feed off of your sort of anxiety and then you'll have students that are likely to take advantage of that. So, the remedy for this and to build off of your sense of calm is to address behaviors as soon as you notice them and be very specific with redirecting. So, one of the things I like to focus our kind of our coaching conversation on is how we can have you offer more specific for student behavior so you can keep doing what? Right. You keep teaching. All right, because you're trying because you've powered through but you, you know, if students and said sorry, I can't hear you and all that and so the goal is to as much of these three directions so you can keep going with the flow of the lesson. Okay? With me so far? All right. So, how could you offer a specific if I'm Dev and if I start doing this?  So, what could you say to redirect my behavior? Away, from what I'm doing?  So yeah, so why is that not effective? So, that's a non specific response? Because what does it do? Perfect. So you got an idea from there, right there. So first is going to name the student. All right. So as much as you might say, well, I don't want to call somebody out, you have -- the student has to know that you're talking to him or her. So, first thing would be Dev. And then what's the next thing you want to say? You want him to stop doing whatever the behaviors that they're doing. So, you got a name that behavior. So Dev.  Stop talking. And then when you have to do to close it out.  Perfect. Yeah. Are you going to redirect it? All right, so in this example, so if I called Dev, and if I start whispering over here, what are our three steps? But so, so practice on me Okay. Okay. Okay. Redirect me, though, that I'm still facing this way. All right. Yeah. Right. So just very, very short, very quick, you know, responses in redirection. So Dev, voices off, please. Eyes on me. Or eyes to the front of the room or something like that because you've identified the name of the student, you've told them or you've identified the behavior that you want them to stop doing. And then you given them something that you do want them to do. Does that make sense? Those three components, so that that makes it as as possible. Okay. So, let's try it again. And I'll be Ethan this time. So let's practice a specific response. I was already facing you. But what do you want to me to do? To? Perfect. All right. Yeah. This is what's one thing again, just look up and listen. All right, but he could do this.  All right. And so you want to be as specific as in telling them what you want to do because what are you still trying to do while you're doing this? You're trying to teach, right? All right. So, what about if I start humming? But -- so, okay. So, practice on me. Whats a response Okay. So, a lot. Just cut to the very . So Ethan, you can just say voices off and eyes up here.  Because he's looking around. You still have to kind of redirect him. All right. So, youre talking about two redirection so we've got Dev, voices off, eyes on me in case you got side conversations. What about an impersonation? So, let's say that, you know, Ethan, it starts going like oh well, I really like my friends. How could you redirect him back to something normal? So Ethan, whats the first thing to do? Ethan? Voices off. Yeah, thats the first thing. Ethan voices off. No impressions. You know, something like that. So, you just tried to be as specific as . To end the behavior and get a redirection.  Okay. I'm excited. What about me? Come one."
